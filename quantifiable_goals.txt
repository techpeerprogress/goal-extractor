Here is the goal extraction analysis from the mastermind call transcript.

---

### George Reyna

**What They Discussed:**

George is dealing with a client who is delaying payment, which has prompted him to explore other opportunities within their network. He's also nearing a larger engagement with another client after a successful "gatekeeper project" and has recently hired a BA/project manager. A major update is his decision to invest in a marketing vendor for cold outreach, moving away from doing it all himself.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

George provided comprehensive updates on his client work, hiring, and new marketing investments, but did not state a specific action or commitment for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @George Great to hear the "gatekeeper project" is converting into a larger engagement! That's a huge win. Your strategy of offering 100 free leads is also super smart.
> 
> I noticed you didn't set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. With the new marketing vendor coming online, this might be a great time to track momentum.
> 
> Here are a few options to lock in:
> 
> • 📞 Have 1 intro call with the new marketing vendor to align on strategy.
> 
> • 🎯 Follow up with the "dangling carrot" client 1 more time.
> 
> • 🎁 Test your "100 free leads" offer with 5 new prospects.
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Paul McRae

**What They Discussed:**

Paul is shifting his outreach strategy from Leads Genius to a new tool, Scribe, which automates content creation and posting based on his own library of materials. He's already launched three posts this past week. He also kicked off two new contracts—one he feels has strong potential (quantum database) and another he's apprehensive about (AI for commercial sector), as the client may be overconfident. His week has been significantly complicated by a fully torn tricep, which requires a long recovery and has forced him to put a larger marketing engagement on hold.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Create lists of mid-sized consulting firms to target for a partnership model.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment specifies a distinct action ("looking for lists"), a target ("mid sized consulting firms"), and a clear time reference ("this afternoon"), making it measurable and time-bound.

**Exact Quote:**

"one of the things I'm going to do this afternoon It. is I'm looking for lists of mid sized consulting firms, revenues up to about 150 million."

**Timestamp:**

(31m 23s)

### Amanda Kabak

**What They Discussed:**

Amanda first asked for the name of the content tool Paul was using (Scribe). Later, she shared that she is struggling with a similar challenge to Ben: she chose a niche that isn't working out and, as a software generalist, she finds it difficult to pick a new one.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Amanda asked a clarifying question and shared her current challenge but did not commit to any specific action for the next week.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Amanda Thanks for sharing where you're at with picking a niche. It’s a tough spot to be in, especially as a generalist with broad skills.
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for this. Totally understandable when you're in a phase of re-evaluation.
> 
> Here are a few small, concrete options to explore what's next:
> 
> • 🧠 Brainstorm 3 potential new niches based on past projects you enjoyed.
> 
> • 📞 Reach out to 1 person in an interesting industry for a quick "curiosity call."
> 
> • ✍️ List the top 5 problems you are most skilled at solving, regardless of industry.
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Nirav Sheth

**What They Discussed:**

Nirav shared his past frustrations with lead generation services. His major update is a strategic pivot from targeting private equity firms to focusing on "search funds," which he believes are a better fit after a recent client experience. He also landed a new hourly contract with his former employer to help a healthcare client, which he accepted to generate revenue after a seven-month dry spell.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Make a pivot and reach out to search funds.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment expresses a clear intention to pivot but the action "reach out to search funds" is vague, lacking a specific number of contacts or a timeframe for the outreach.

**Exact Quote:**

"So instead of going after private equity funds, I think I'm going to make a pivot and see if I can actually reach out to search funds, right?"

**Timestamp:**

(54m 40s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Identify 15 search funds to target" OR "Draft an outreach message and send it to 5 search funds."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Nirav Huge congrats on signing the contract with your ex-employer! That's a fantastic win. The pivot to search funds also sounds like a really sharp, strategic move.
> 
> I noticed your goal to "reach out" wasn't **quantifiable**. No worries, especially when you're just starting a new angle.
> 
> To get the ball rolling, how about one of these?
> 
> • 🔎 Identify 10 search funds that fit your ideal criteria.
> 
> • ✍️ Draft your core outreach message tailored to searchers' pain points.
> 
> • 🚀 Send your new outreach message to 3 search funds.
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Divya asked an insightful question to the group but did not provide an update on her own progress or set a goal for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Divya Great question on the call about Apollo and Clay! It sparked a really valuable discussion on cold outreach tactics.

### Ben Benone

**What They Discussed:**

Ben, who is new to the group, shared that his main focus is on getting started and nailing down a niche. This is his last week at his full-time job, and he feels stuck trying to choose a direction. His background is in slow-moving industries like higher education and pharmaceuticals, which he finds frustrating due to the long sales cycles, but all his contacts are there.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Meet with Lior and have calls to refine his business ideas.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment involves a specific, verifiable action ("meeting with LIOR") and has a clear deadline ("tomorrow"), making it a time-bound and measurable goal.

**Exact Quote:**

"I have some calls tomorrow. I'm going to be meeting with LIOR just because to try to, to do some, some, some refinement of some of the ideas I have."

**Timestamp:**

(45m 26s)

### David Taiwo

**What They Discussed:**

David introduced himself to the group and offered advice to Ben based on his own experience. He explained that he tried to move away from his "bread and butter" area of expertise but found himself circling back because it was what he knew best and could talk about in his sleep.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

David provided advice and context from his own journey but did not share any updates or future commitments for his own business.

Here is the analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

### Joel

**What They Discussed:**

Joel feels a recurring 'stuckness' with outreach, admitting that his comfortable level of income and work reduces his motivation to "hustle." He shared that traditional cold outreach doesn't feel like his style. Inspired by a recommendation, he explored Jason Elkins' "100 Cups Academy," a network-based approach, which feels more aligned with his personality. He had a successful call with Jason and plans to join the program.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Sign up for the "100 Cups" course and consume as much of it as possible.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While "sign up" is a specific action, "inhale as much of that course as I can" is vague and not measurable. It lacks a clear deliverable or quantity.

**Exact Quote:**

"Probably my main to do this week is to sign up for that and to inhale as much of that course as I can."

**Timestamp:**

(21m 10s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Sign up for the course and complete the first 3 modules" OR "Sign up for the course and use its method to schedule 2 coffee chats."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Joel Great call exploring the "100 Cups" method—it sounds like a perfect fit for your style of building relationships.
>
> I noticed your goal for this week wasn't quite quantifiable. Totally understandable when you're about to dive into a new course and don't know the structure yet.
>
> To help you build momentum, how about one of these options?
>
> • 🎓 Sign up and complete the first 2 modules
>
> • ☕ Sign up and schedule your first coffee chat using the framework
>
> • 📝 Sign up and create a list of the first 10 people you plan to contact
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Tim Faith

**What They Discussed:**

Tim shared his recent success with network-based outreach, which validated Joel's interest in the "100 Cups" method. He explained that his approach involves reconnecting with people he genuinely likes and asking for advice, which has naturally led to introductions and leads. His primary challenge now is figuring out how to transition these warm conversations into formal business opportunities without feeling like he is abusing the relationship.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Tim discussed his ongoing process and posed his current challenge to the group for advice, but he did not commit to a specific new action for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'll let y'all know as I keep on hammering away at it."

**Timestamp:**

(32m 49s)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Tim It's awesome to hear how much success you're having with network outreach—it’s clearly working!
>
> During the call, you were focused on the challenge of turning those great chats into business, so we didn't lock in a quantifiable goal for you. It's a tricky but important step.
>
> Here are a few ideas to formalize that transition:
>
> • 📝 Create a 1-page summary of your services to share after a good call
>
> • ➡️ Draft a script with 2-3 options for asking "who else should I talk to?"
>
> • 📞 Follow up with 1 past conversation to test a more direct business approach
>
> Would you like me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week?

### Andy Levy

**What They Discussed:**

Andy contributed to the discussion by offering a philosophical perspective on the entrepreneurial journey. He used the analogy of needing to "blaze your own trail," suggesting that there is no formulaic path to success in this field. He emphasized the need to be comfortable receiving guidance but also creating one's own direction. He left the call early before providing a personal update.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Andy provided advice and perspective to the group but did not share an update on his own progress or set a goal for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Andy Loved your "blaze your own trail" analogy—it really captures the entrepreneurial spirit.
>
> You had to jump off before we got to your update, so we didn't get a chance to set a quantifiable goal for you this week.

> To help you keep blazing that trail, here are a few potential goals:
>
> • 🗺️ Define the next 3 steps on your business "trail"
>
> • 🤝 Reach out to 5 new contacts for discovery calls

### Pankil Patel

**What They Discussed:**

Pankil shared that he is new to the program and feels he is progressing slowly, partly because he is in "stealth" mode and can't dedicate as much time as he'd like. He has defined his Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and just started creating LinkedIn posts this past week. He is currently working on implementing personal LinkedIn outreach based on guidance he received.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Pankil provided a status update on his current activities and challenges but did not state a specific, forward-looking commitment for the next week.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Pankil Congrats on starting your LinkedIn posts this week—getting started is the hardest part, and you did it! 👏

### Daniel Maynes

**What They Discussed:**

Daniel feels he is finally getting "unstuck" on his marketing efforts. He has a new, more refined ICP (companies using Microsoft Dynamics without a CTO), has received large lead lists, and is in the process of hiring a new VA after firing his previous one. His main focus is on generating a sales playbook for his new campaign and starting network activation with about 100 LinkedIn connections.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Generate a sales playbook and begin network activation meetings over the next couple of weeks.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment lacks specificity ("generate... the sales playbook" is not a clear deliverable) and a specific number for the meetings. The timeline of "the next couple of weeks" is also not tied to the next call.

**Exact Quote:**

"that's, that's going to be my focus for the next, for the next couple of weeks."

**Timestamp:**

(36m 41s)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Daniel It's great to hear you're feeling unstuck and have a clear direction with your new ICP and lead lists! That's a huge step forward.
>
> I noticed your goal to create the playbook and start outreach was a bit broad. It sounds like you have a lot to tackle, and sometimes breaking it down helps.
>
> How about one of these smaller, concrete goals for this week?
>
> • 📝 Outline the 5 main sections of your new sales playbook
>
> • 📞 Reach out to 10 of your 100 LinkedIn connections to schedule calls
>
> • 🎯 Finalize the interview process and hire your new VA
>
> Would you like to lock one of these in for accountability on our next call?

### Bob Stewart

**What They Discussed:**

Bob has made significant progress on multiple fronts. He is finishing his new studio, has refined the messaging for his CTO/CEO community, and has developed an extensive go-to-market strategy. He shared a detailed plan to create a high-ticket consulting agency that leverages CTOX members as a talent pool, targeting large-scale projects from VCs, PE firms, and family offices.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Condense the messaging for his new business model and prepare a version of it for an upcoming CTOX "Show and Tell" presentation.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment uses vague terms like "condensing that messaging down" and "preparing the... version," which lack clear, measurable deliverables.

**Exact Quote:**

"that's really what I'll be doing in, in the next week. Here is condensing that messaging down and then preparing the CTOX version of what I just shared for the upcoming, whatever they call it, like, sessions with George."

**Timestamp:**

(1h 19m 52s)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Bob That business model you've built is incredibly thorough and impressive—seriously inspiring stuff.
>
> I noted down your goal was to "condense the messaging" for your presentation. That's a big task, and it might help to break it into a clear deliverable for this week.
>
> A few options to make it more concrete:
>
> • 📄 Create a 1-page executive summary of the model
>
> • 📊 Draft the first 5 slides for your "Show and Tell" deck
>
> • 🎯 Finalize the 3 core value propositions for your target audience (VCs, PEs)
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for the check-in next week?

Here is the expert analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

### Filip Szalewicz

**What They Discussed:**

Filip celebrated signing a new client, which kicks off tomorrow. This has highlighted some gaps in his operational readiness. He also shared that he terminated a third-party outbound email service that wasn't performing and now strongly advocates for entrepreneurs to build their own lead-gen competency. He recommended Dripify for LinkedIn automation and SlideSpeak for creating lead magnets, which he plans to integrate into his Go High Level CRM to nurture leads.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Filip provided a detailed update on his wins (new client) and strategic shifts (terminating a vendor, adopting new tools) but did not state a specific, actionable commitment for the upcoming week that he wants the group to hold him accountable for. His focus is on onboarding the new client.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

(N/A)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Filip Huge congrats on signing the new client and getting the engagement kicked off this week! 🚀 It’s also a major win that you’ve found a powerful toolstack with Dripify and SlideSpeak.

### Tony Winter

**What They Discussed:**

Tony is currently managing three promising opportunities. One prospect who had gone silent for weeks suddenly re-engaged, and he has a workshop and another call scheduled. This influx of activity has created a sense of urgency for him to solidify his own client onboarding playbook so he's prepared for "day one." He noted that most of his recent success has come from activating his personal network on LinkedIn.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Build out his own kind of playbook.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "build out" a "playbook" and create a "skeleton" is vague. It lacks a specific, measurable deliverable or outcome that can be clearly verified as complete.

**Exact Quote:**

"So that's going to be the focus this week." (referring to "taking all of the different serve information and just building out my own kind of playbook")

**Timestamp:**

(31m 7s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Create a 1-page 'First 30 Days' client roadmap" OR "Draft the 5 key sections of my client onboarding playbook."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Tony Fantastic news on those three opportunities moving forward, especially the one that came back from the dead! It’s a great sign your network activation is paying off.
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call for building your playbook. Totally get it—it’s a big task and it’s easy to get lost in the details.
> 
> To make it more concrete, here are a few options to lock in for next week:
> 
> • 🗺️ Outline the **5** main sections of your client playbook (e.g., Discovery, Audit, Roadmap, etc.)
> 
> • 📄 Draft a **1-page** "Day One" client onboarding checklist
> 
> • 📝 Create a template for your first weekly client status report
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Joel Key

**What They Discussed:**

Joel shared that a founder he met is interested in a 30-minute workshop concept that would produce a 4-5 page strategic report, and they are meeting this Friday to run it. He also has another interested company for the same workshop. His primary focus is preparing the content for this workshop and refining his one-pager to more clearly articulate his value proposition and scope of services.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Focus on getting ready for the workshop, prepping content, and polishing his one-pager.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goals "getting ready," "prepping content," and "polishing" are activities, not measurable outcomes. They lack specific numbers or a clear definition of "done."

**Exact Quote:**

"So this week's focus on getting ready for that, having a lot of the content prep now that I've got the interest and then really polishing my one pager, getting that cleaned up."

**Timestamp:**

(38m 2s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Finalize the 5 key questions for the workshop" OR "Complete the first draft of my one-pager and share it with 2 people for feedback."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Joel Awesome work turning a conversation into a scheduled workshop—that’s a fantastic way to validate your offer! It’s great you have another company interested already.
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. With a workshop to prep, it’s easy for the to-do list to feel a bit abstract.
> 
> Here are a few ways to lock in your progress for next week:
> 
> • 📝 Finalize the **5** core questions you'll ask during the workshop
> 
> • 📄 Complete the V1 draft of your one-pager

### Michael Shepard

**What They Discussed:**

Michael provided a brief update on his pipeline, sharing that one client has verbally committed to an advisory role starting next quarter. However, another potential client in New York decided not to move forward as they preferred someone local. He contributed to the conversation by mentioning the "Fractional Jobs IO" website as a resource for finding roles.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Michael shared a status update on his client pipeline but did not commit to any specific actions or goals for the upcoming week.

### John Fitzpatrick CTOx

**What They Discussed:**

John detailed a significant technical win for a client, where he used AI tools to discover undocumented Adobe Illustrator tags to solve a complex problem. He is now leading a data automation project for that client, managing a team of developers. He also shared progress on a personal app he's building to automate his LinkedIn content creation, with the goal of launching a campaign to rebrand his business soon.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Start his LinkedIn campaign this week or early next week.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "start doing the stuff" is vague, and the timeline of "this week or at the latest next" is not a firm, single deadline, making it difficult to hold him accountable.

**Exact Quote:**

"...with how things are running right now, I should be able to start doing the stuff this week or at the latest next. Early next week."

**Timestamp:**

(1h 2m 34s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Publish the first 2 posts of my LinkedIn rebranding campaign" OR "Finalize the content calendar for my 7-day launch campaign."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @John That story about finding the undocumented Adobe tags was incredible—a perfect example of using AI for high-level problem-solving! It's also awesome to see the progress on your content generation app.
> 
> I noticed your goal to launch the LinkedIn campaign didn’t have a specific **quantifiable target**. I know how easy it is for "this week" to become "next week" when you're deep in client work.
> 
> To make it official, here are a few options:
> 
> • 🚀 Publish post #1 of your rebranding campaign
> 
> • 🗓️ Finalize the topics and schedule for all **7** days of the campaign

### Donny Grover

**What They Discussed:**

As a new member, Donny is focused on following the CTOX plan and internalizing the curriculum. He had a very positive first meeting with a potential client and is now preparing to send them a proposal. His main challenge is ensuring the proposal clearly separates his fractional CTO services from traditional web development work, which requires him to practice communicating his new strategic role effectively.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Donny shared an update on his progress and a current challenge (writing the proposal) but did not make a specific commitment for the group to hold him accountable to for the next call. His focus is on learning and executing on the opportunity in front of him.

The commitment to "push those things out" and "get those calls to happen" is vague. It lacks a specific number of outreach messages to send, posts to publish, or calls to schedule, making the outcome unmeasurable.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm going to push those things out, hopefully get those calls to happen in this next week, connecting with those folks."

**Timestamp:**

(20m 1s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send cold outreach emails to 25 people from my Apollo list" OR "Schedule 2 calls with network contacts" OR "Publish the LinkedIn post about credit unions."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Jeremie Great work building that Apollo list and drafting the LinkedIn post—it sounds like you have some powerful assets ready to go!
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. Totally understandable when you're shifting from planning to execution.
>
> To help you lock in that momentum, here are a few options:
>
> • 🚀 Send cold outreach to the first 25 people on your Apollo list
>
> • 📞 Schedule 1 call with a network contact
>
> • ✍️ Publish that LinkedIn post targeting credit unions
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Will May

**What They Discussed:**

Will is expanding his one-pager into a two-page reference document by adding more substantial content, like project details with quantifiable results, and is using AI to refine the messaging. He continues to have strategic meetings with his partners, John and Paul, to define their process. He also shared that he is actively working with a company called Altitude 80 on an exciting AI modernization project involving legacy code.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Finish his two-page document, continue network outreach, and continue meeting with his partners.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goals to "finish up" a document, "continue to drive" outreach, and "continue to meet" are intentions rather than measurable commitments. They lack specific quantities (e.g., number of outreach messages) or clear definitions of "done."

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm in the process of finishing up my version of that... And then I'm going to continue to drive my network outreach... and then we'll continue to meet next week on, on our steps forward..."

**Timestamp:**

(20m 50s, 22m 28s, 22m 12s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the final draft of the two-page reference document" OR "Send 10 personalized network outreach messages on LinkedIn."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Will That Altitude 80 project sounds fascinating, and it's awesome to hear you're leveling up your one-pager with more substance!
>
> On the call, you mentioned continuing outreach and finishing the doc, but didn't set a **quantifiable goal**. I get it—you've got a lot of balls in the air.
>
> Here are a couple of ways to make it concrete:
>
> • 📄 Finalize the content for the back page of your reference document
>
> • 🤝 Send 10 new network outreach messages
>
> • 🗓️ Define and document 1 tangible next step from your next partner meeting
>
> Want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week?

### Mark Alcazar

**What They Discussed:**

Mark had a productive meeting with a VC who gave him valuable feedback on his pitch. The VC suggested creating an AI adoption survey for companies, which Mark believes is a great idea and is now his top priority. He also mentioned he plans to set up his podcast equipment and is refining his LinkedIn outreach strategy to incorporate new stories and ideas.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Get the AI adoption survey done and set up his podcast.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "get it done" for the survey and "get it set up" for the podcast are vague. They lack a specific, verifiable outcome (e.g., a finished draft, a tested setup) that defines what completion looks like.

**Exact Quote:**

"So that's my top goal for next week, is to get it done."

**Timestamp:**

(25m 10s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Create the first draft of the AI adoption survey with at least 10 questions" OR "Send the draft survey to 3 peers for feedback."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mark That's a huge win getting such a powerful idea from your VC meeting! An AI adoption survey sounds like a fantastic lead magnet.
>
> I noticed your goal to "get it done" wasn't quite quantifiable. It's a big task, so breaking it down can help!
>
> Here are a few concrete first steps you could commit to:
>
> • 📝 Draft the first 10 questions for the AI survey
>
> •  feedback from 2 trusted people on the survey concept
>
> • 🎙️ Set up and complete a 5-minute test recording with your podcast gear
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Mack Earnhardt | Agile Reasoning

**What They Discussed:**

He feels she's helping him understand his work style better (based on his Colby profile). He feels he's "lost the plot" on specific next steps but is optimistic that an upcoming follow-up call with Marissa and a "Clients by Christmas" workshop will provide clarity.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made; he is waiting for more clarity.

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

Mack explicitly stated he feels "lost the plot on what I really ought to be doing" and is waiting for his next coaching call and a workshop to help him define his next steps.

**Exact Quote:**

"as far as, you know, commitments for next week. I've, I've a little bit lost the plot on what I really ought to be doing. But you know, I think my next conversation with her will bring some clarity."

**Timestamp:**

(31m 47s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"After the Friday workshop, define and write down 1 specific outreach action to take" OR "From your next call with Marissa, identify and commit to your #1 business priority for the next 30 days."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mack It's awesome that you connected with Marissa and that it's already bringing you some clarity—that's a huge step forward. Also, congrats on getting the RV back on the road!
>
> I heard that you're waiting for your next call and the workshop to set a direction. That makes total sense.
>
> To make sure that new clarity turns into action, how about one of these as a goal?
>
> • 🎯 After the Friday workshop, identify and write down your #1 business priority
>
> • ✍️ Based on your talk with Marissa, commit to 1 specific action that aligns with your Colby profile
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these once you have that clarity? No pressure to decide now, we can lock it in after your sessions.

### nelan

**What They Discussed:**

As a new member, Nelan's focus was on understanding the group's dynamics and processes. He mentioned meeting Mark at a recent dinner and shared that he is working through his onboarding documents. He asked clarifying questions about the weekly commitment cadence, the format of other group calls, and the tools others were using (like Apollo and Scribe).

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made.

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Nelan was in an information-gathering mode, participating for the first time. His contributions were questions aimed at getting oriented within the group, and he did not set a business goal.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the 'Four Freedoms' and 'Money Math' onboarding documents" OR "Post my first weekly commitment update in Slack next Tuesday."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @nelan Welcome to the group! It was great having you on the call today.
>
> Since it was your first one, you didn't set a goal, which is perfectly fine. The first step is just getting oriented!
>
> To help you get started, here are a couple of simple, concrete goals members often tackle in their first week:
>
> • 📝 Complete your 'Four Freedoms' and 'Money Math' docs
>

### jonbenedict

**What They Discussed:**

Jonbenedict is collaborating with Will and Paul to create a standardized playbook for their healthcare consultancy, using his current hospital engagement as a model. He shared a detailed story about the significant cultural and security issues at his client's site, including HIPAA compliance risks and an inept director creating a culture of fear. He also successfully moved apartments to secure a reliable Wi-Fi connection.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Deliver a document outlining his work as a set of standard offerings to Will and Paul, and create one LinkedIn post.

**Classification:**

✅ Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment contains two specific, measurable actions with a clear time frame ("next week"). Delivering a document is a binary (done/not done) task, and creating "a LinkedIn post" specifies a quantity of one.

**Exact Quote:**

"So that's what I'll do for next week. I'm going to deliver to Will and Paul kind of what I've done here as an example of offerings, and I'll do a LinkedIn post..."

**Timestamp:**

(52m 56s)
