Here is the expert goal extraction analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

---

### George Reyna

**What They Discussed:**

George is managing a tricky client situation where a large contract is pending, making him feel like a carrot is being dangled. On a positive note, a smaller "gatekeeper project" with another client has successfully concluded after several months, and they are now moving toward a larger engagement. He has also hired a BA/PM and invested in a marketing agency for cold outreach, expressing hope for a "windfall" of new clients.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

George provided a detailed update on his client work, hiring, and new marketing investments but did not state a specific, forward-looking commitment for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @George Great to hear the "gatekeeper project" converted into a larger engagement—that's a huge win and proof of your strategy! It's also exciting that you've invested in a marketing agency to scale your outreach.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. With the new agency spinning up, it's a perfect time to set a clear target to keep momentum high.
>
> Here are a few options to lock in:
>
> • 📞 Get on at least 1 call that the new agency sets up.
>
> • 📝 Finalize the onboarding or campaign brief for the marketing agency.
>
> • 💡 Offer your "100 free leads" package to 3 new prospects yourself.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Paul McRae

**What They Discussed:**

Paul is shifting his outreach strategy away from Leads Genius to a new AI tool called Scribe, which helps generate and schedule content based on his own materials. He celebrated kicking off two new contracts this week but expressed some apprehension about one of them. He also shared a significant personal setback—a fully torn tricep that requires a long recovery and has forced him to put a potential marketing engagement on hold.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Look for lists of mid-sized consulting firms to create a partner model.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment is an action ("looking for lists") with a timeframe ("this afternoon"), but it lacks a measurable outcome. It doesn't specify how many firms to identify or what the deliverable is (e.g., a finalized list of 10 companies).

**Exact Quote:**

"one of the things I'm going to do this afternoon It. is I'm looking for lists of mid sized consulting firms, revenues up to about 150 million. And I'm trying to create a partner model for this quantum database company..."

**Timestamp:**

(31m 23s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Identify and build a list of 20 mid-sized consulting firms using Apollo" OR "Draft the initial partner model proposal and share it with 1 advisor for feedback."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Paul Kicking off two contracts in one week is fantastic momentum! Also, thanks for sharing Scribe—sounds like a powerful tool for streamlining content.
>
> I noticed your goal to find consulting firms wasn't fully **quantifiable**. Totally understandable, especially with the tricep injury throwing a wrench in things.
>
> To make that partner search more concrete, here are a couple of options:
>
> • 🎯 Identify 15 mid-sized consulting firms that fit your partner criteria.
>
> • 📝 Outline the key value props for your partner model.
>
> • 📧 Send a connection request to 5 potential partners from that list.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in? (And hope the recovery is going as smoothly as possible!)

### Amanda Kabak

**What They Discussed:**

Amanda shared that she is struggling to find the right niche for her business. After her initial choice didn't work out, she's now trying to figure out how to pivot and select a new one. As a software generalist with broad experience, she finds it challenging to narrow her focus.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Amanda shared her current challenge and situation but did not commit to a specific action or goal for the upcoming week to address it.

**Exact Quote:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Amanda Thanks for being open about the niche challenge—it's something so many of us face, and it takes courage to pivot when something isn't working.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. I get it, you're in exploration mode, but a small, concrete step could help create clarity.
>
> Here are a few ideas to get the ball rolling:
>
> • 📝 List 3 potential new niches based on your past project experience.
>
> • 📞 Schedule 1 conversation with a contact in a potential new niche to learn about their pain points.
>
> • 💡 Brainstorm 5 service offerings you could provide, independent of niche, to see what energizes you most.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Nirav Sheth

**What They Discussed:**

Nirav has decided to pivot his business focus after finding that his target niche of private equity was not yielding results. Based on a successful client engagement, he plans to start targeting "search funds" instead, as he believes the price point and service model are a better fit. He also secured a win by signing an hourly contract with his former employer to assist a healthcare client.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Make a pivot and reach out to search funds.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While Nirav has made a clear strategic decision to pivot, the commitment to "reach out to search funds" is vague. It lacks a specific number of contacts or a defined action for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"So instead of going after private equity funds, I think I'm going to make a pivot and see if I can actually reach out to search funds, right?"

**Timestamp:**

(54m 40s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Identify 25 search funds to target" OR "Send outreach messages to 5 search fund managers" OR "Update my LinkedIn profile to reflect the new focus on search funds."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Nirav Huge congrats on signing the contract with your ex-employer! That's a massive win and great validation. The pivot to search funds sounds like a really smart, strategic move too.
>
> I noticed your goal to reach out to them wasn't fully **quantifiable** yet. Now that you have a clear direction, locking in a specific first step could build quick momentum.
>
> How about one of these?
>
> • 🎯 Build a target list of 20 search funds.
>
> • ✍️ Draft your core outreach message tailored to searchers.
>
> • 🔗 Connect with 5 search fund principals on LinkedIn.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Divya Malhotra

**What They Discussed:**

Divya participated briefly by asking the group about their experiences with cold emailing tools like Apollo and Clay. She also connected with David, noting they are both based in Connecticut.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Divya only asked questions and did not provide an update on her business or set a goal.

**Exact Quote:**

**Timestamp:**

### Ben Benone

**What They Discussed:**

As a new member, Ben shared that his primary focus is getting started, which includes nailing down his business name and niche. He is leaving his full-time job this week. His background is in slow-moving industries like higher education and pharma, and while his contacts are there, he is hesitant to stay due to the long sales cycles.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Meet with Lior to refine his business ideas.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This is a specific action with a timeframe ("tomorrow"), but it is a preparatory step rather than a business-building goal with a measurable outcome. The goal of the meeting is to *get* clarity, not to deliver a specific result.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm going to be meeting with LIOR just because to try to, to do some, some, some refinement of some of the ideas I have."

**Timestamp:**

(45m 27s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Based on the Lior call, decide on a single target niche to test for one month" OR "Create a list of 3 potential business names and get feedback from 2 peers."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Ben Congrats on this being your last week at your full-time gig—that's a huge milestone! It’s also smart to connect with Lior right away for guidance.
>
> I noticed your goal was the meeting itself, which is a great step. To make sure that valuable conversation translates into action, it might help to set a **quantifiable goal** for what comes *after* the call.
>
> Here are a few options:
>
> • 🎯 Decide on 1 niche to test for the next 30 days.
>
> • 📝 Outline your core service offering based on Lior's feedback.
>
> • 📞 Schedule 2 exploratory calls with contacts in your potential new niche.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### David Taiwo

**What They Discussed:**

David shared his personal experience with niching down, advising Ben that he initially tried to get away from his area of expertise but eventually circled back to it. He suggested that sometimes your "bread and butter" is the best place to focus because you can speak about it fluently.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

David provided valuable advice and perspective based on his own journey but did not share an update on his own business or set a goal for the week ahead.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @David That was really insightful advice you shared with Ben about circling back to your "bread and butter." It's a powerful reminder to lean into our strengths.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for yourself during the call. To keep your own momentum going, it might be helpful to lock something in.
>
> Thinking about your advice, here are a few potential goals:
>
> • ✍️ Write 1 piece of content (e.g., a LinkedIn post) about your core area of expertise.
>
> • 📞 Reconnect with 3 past clients or colleagues from your "bread and butter" niche.
>
> • 💡 Refine your primary service offering into a one-sentence pitch.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

Here is the expert analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

### Joel

**What They Discussed:**

Joel shared his ongoing challenge with outreach. He feels comfortable with his current income and workload, which diminishes his motivation to "hustle" for new business. He explained his recent exploration of a network-based outreach method recommended by another member, Matthew, called the "100 cups academy." He had a call with the founder, Jason Elkins, which went well, and he feels this relationship-focused approach is a better fit for him than cold outreach.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Sign up for the "100 cups" course and start studying it.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While "sign up" is a specific action, "inhale as much of that course as I can" is vague and not measurable. It lacks a specific number of modules to complete or a defined outcome for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"Probably my main to do this week is to sign up for that and to inhale as much of that course as I can."

**Timestamp:**

(21m 10s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the first 3 modules of the course and identify 10 people in my network to contact" OR "Sign up for the course and schedule the first 2 coffee chats."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Joel Great move taking action on Matthew's advice and connecting with Jason Elkins! It sounds like you found an outreach method that really resonates with your style.
> 
> 
> I noticed your goal for the week wasn’t quite **quantifiable**. Totally understandable when you're just starting a new course and figuring out the scope.
> 
> To help you build momentum, here are a few options you could lock in:
> 
> • 🎓 Sign up and complete the first 3 modules of the course
> 
> • 📝 Create a list of the first 20 people you plan to reach out to
> 
> • 🗓️ Complete the first module and schedule your first coffee chat
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?
>

### Tim Faith

**What They Discussed:**

Tim shared his recent success with network activation, explaining how casual "cup of coffee" style conversations with people he likes have naturally led to valuable introductions. His primary "stuckness" is figuring out the next step: how to transition these warm conversations and introductions into tangible business opportunities without feeling like he is abusing the relationship. He is looking for a way to move from the friendly chat to the entrepreneurial follow-up.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Tim clearly articulated his current challenge and said he would "keep on hammering away at it," but he did not commit to a specific action or experiment for the upcoming week to solve it.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'll let y'all know as I keep on hammering away at it."

**Timestamp:**

(32m 49s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Ask 3 of my next coffee chats the question 'Who else should I be talking to about this?'" OR "Draft a follow-up email template to send after introduction calls" OR "Follow up with 2 of the introductions he received last week."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Tim It’s awesome to hear how well your authentic networking is going—turning good relationships into warm intros is a huge win!
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** to tackle that next step of converting those intros. It's a tricky transition, and it makes sense to be thoughtful about how to do it right.
> 
> To help you experiment, here are a few ideas:
> 
> • ❓ In your next 3 coffee chats, ask the question: "Who else do you think I should be talking to?"
> 
> • 📧 Draft one standard follow-up email template to use after an initial intro call.
> 
> • 📞 Follow up with 2 of the warm introductions you've already received.
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?
>

### Andy Levy

**What They Discussed:**

Andy did not provide a personal update. He responded to Tim’s challenge by offering a perspective on the entrepreneurial journey within the program, suggesting that there is no formulaic path and that success requires being comfortable with "blazing your own trail." Shortly after, he announced he had to leave the call early to prepare for another meeting.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Andy's role in the call was to provide advice and perspective to another member before leaving. He did not share a personal update or set any goals.

### Pankil Patel

**What They Discussed:**

Pankil introduced himself as being new to the program (1.5 months in) and acknowledged his progress has been slow due to limited time. He has successfully defined his Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and just started creating LinkedIn posts this week, which are getting some engagement. His current focus is on figuring out how to do personalized LinkedIn outreach.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Pankil gave a status update on what he is currently working on ("that's the one that I'm trying to do right now") but did not set a forward-looking commitment with a specific target for the week ahead.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A (He described his current activity, not a future commitment)

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send 10 personalized LinkedIn connection requests to people in my ICP" OR "Write and schedule 2 LinkedIn posts for next week" OR "Spend 3 hours researching my ICP on LinkedIn Sales Navigator."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Pankil Welcome! It's great that you've already started posting on LinkedIn and are seeing engagement—that's a fantastic first step.
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. Totally get it, especially when you're just getting started and time is tight.
> 
> To help you keep the momentum going, here are a few small, concrete options:
> 
> • ✍️ Write and schedule 2 LinkedIn posts
>

### Daniel Maynes

**What They Discussed:**

Daniel shared that he is finally feeling "unstuck" on his marketing efforts. He has a new, more refined ICP targeting companies that use Microsoft Dynamics but lack a CTO. He fired his previous VA, is interviewing a new one, and received large lead lists from a friend. His focus for the near future is to create a sales playbook for this new campaign and also begin network activation with about 100 of his LinkedIn connections.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Focus on generating a sales playbook and starting a new campaign, as well as reaching out to LinkedIn connections.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment is framed as a "focus for the next couple of weeks" rather than a specific goal for next week. Actions like "generate" a playbook and "get that going" are vague without a clear definition of "done."

**Exact Quote:**

"that's, that's going to be my focus for the next, for the next couple of weeks."

**Timestamp:**

(36m 41s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Outline the 5 main sections of the new sales playbook" OR "Clean the first 500 contacts from the new lead list" OR "Send outreach messages to 10 of the 100 LinkedIn connections."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Daniel It's great to hear you're feeling unstuck and have so much clarity on your new ICP and marketing plan! Firing a VA that isn't working is a bold and necessary move.
> 
> 
> I noticed your goal was more of a focus area for the next couple of weeks rather than a **quantifiable goal** for this one. Makes sense when you're juggling a few big moving parts.
> 
> To help you lock in some progress, here are a few options:
> 
> • 📖 Create the outline for your new sales playbook
> 
> • 🧹 Clean and segment the first 500 contacts from your new lead list
> 
> • 🔗 Reach out to 10 of your 100 LinkedIn connections for a catch-up
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?
>

### Bob Stewart

**What They Discussed:**

Bob gave a comprehensive update on a new, large-scale venture he is building. His production studio is nearly finished, and he has developed a full go-to-market strategy for a high-end consulting service that functions as a deal pipeline. The model will leverage CTOX members as vetted talent for large, high-ticket projects ($500k+) for VCs, PEs, and family offices. He has detailed the entire process, from deal scoring and pricing to the financial breakdown and member roles.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Condense the messaging for his new venture and prepare a version of his presentation for an upcoming CTOX "Show and Tell."

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

"Condensing that messaging down" is an action without a specific, measurable outcome. "Preparing the CTOX version" is closer, but still lacks a clear deliverable (e.g., a finished slide deck, a one-page summary).

**Exact Quote:**

"that's really what I'll be doing in, in the next week. Here is condensing that messaging down and then preparing the CTOX version of what I just shared for the upcoming, whatever they call it, like, sessions with George."

**Timestamp:**

(1h 19m 52s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Create a 1-page executive summary of the go-to-market plan" OR "Finalize the 10-slide deck for the CTOX Show and Tell" OR "Write 3 different versions of the core value proposition."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Bob Wow, that go-to-market strategy you've built is incredibly impressive and thorough! The vision to create a high-end deal pipeline for the community is massive.
> 
> 
> I noticed your goal to condense the messaging wasn’t fully **quantifiable**. It’s a common challenge when you have such a big vision and need to distill it down.
> 
> To help you create a concrete asset, here are a few options for the week:
> 
> • 📄 Draft a 1-page executive summary of the entire model
> 
> • 💡 Write 3 different versions of the core value proposition (one for VCs, one for CTOs, one for family offices)
> 
> • ✅ Finalize the slide deck for your CTOX Show and Tell presentation
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

Session Date: 2025-10-29
================================================================================

Here is the analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

---

### Filip Szalewicz

**What They Discussed:**

Filip announced that he signed a contract with a new client, with the kickoff scheduled for the next day. This has created urgency around solidifying his internal processes. He also shared that he terminated a third-party outbound marketing service that was underperforming, which taught him the importance of developing his own lead-generation competency. He is now successfully using Dripify for LinkedIn automation and SlideSpeak to create lead magnets for his sales funnel.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Filip provided a comprehensive status update on his new client, marketing tools, and AI experiments, but he did not commit to a specific, future-oriented task for the upcoming week. His focus is on the immediate client kickoff.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

(N/A)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Filip Huge congrats on signing the new client and kicking off the project tomorrow! That's a massive win.
> 
> I noticed you didn't set a **quantifiable goal** for next week during the call—totally understandable with the new client work spinning up so fast.
> 
> To keep the marketing momentum going in the background, here are a few options you could lock in:
> 
> • 🚀 Launch 1 new Dripify campaign using your lead magnet
> 
> • 🎨 Create 2 new lead magnets with SlideSpeak
> 
> • 🗺️ Map out the 30-day onboarding plan for your new client
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

---

### Tony Winter

**What They Discussed:**

Tony is managing three active opportunities, one of which unexpectedly re-engaged after weeks of silence. This has created a sense of urgency for him to be prepared for client delivery. He mentioned that, like Filip, he feels he has moved beyond the initial checklists and needs to consolidate his own service delivery framework. Most of his leads have come from activating his personal network, which has also helped him refine his messaging.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Build out his own client service playbook.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment has a time reference ("this week"), but the action "build out" and the deliverable "playbook" are too vague to be measured or verified.

**Exact Quote:**

"So that's going to be the focus this week."

**Timestamp:**

(31m 7s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

“Draft the first 3 sections of my client service playbook” OR “Create a V1 outline of my 90-day client onboarding plan.”

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Tony Great to hear about those three opportunities heating up, especially the one that came back from radio silence!
> 
> I noticed the goal to build out your playbook wasn't quite **quantifiable**. Totally get wanting to have a solid plan ready *before* a client signs—it's a very smart move.
> 
> Here are a few concrete options to make it happen:
> 
> • ✍️ Draft the first 3 sections of your client playbook
> 
> • ✅ Outline your 'Day 1' client onboarding checklist
> 
> • 🗺️ Finalize a V1 of your 90-day client engagement plan
> 
> Want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week?

### Joel Key

**What They Discussed:**

Joel shared that a founder gave him direct feedback that a 30-minute workshop producing a 4-5 page strategic report would be valuable. He has a meeting scheduled with that founder for Friday to pilot this idea and has already generated interest from another company. His main focus now is preparing the content for this new workshop and polishing his one-pager to better articulate his value proposition.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Focus on getting ready for the workshop and polishing his one-pager.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes general intentions like "getting ready" and "polishing," which lack specific, measurable outcomes or deliverables.

**Exact Quote:**

"So this week's focus on getting ready for that, having a lot of the content prep now that I've got the interest and then really polishing my one pager, getting that cleaned up."

**Timestamp:**

(38m 2s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

“Finalize the template for the 4-page report” OR “Complete the V1 slide deck for the 30-minute workshop.”

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Joel Awesome that you got direct feedback from a founder and are already building a workshop to meet that need—that's a huge win!
> 
> I noticed your goal to prep the workshop and polish the one-pager wasn't quite **quantifiable**. It sounds like you're making great progress turning conversations into tangible offers.
> 
> Here are a few options to lock in that progress:
> 
> • 📄 Finalize the template for the 4-page workshop report
> 
> • 💻 Complete the V1 slide deck for the 30-min workshop
> 
> • 🗣️ Share your polished one-pager with 2 peers for feedback
> 
> Want to lock one of these in for next week's check-in?

### Michael Shepard

**What They Discussed:**

Michael provided a brief update on his client pipeline. He has secured one advisory client who will start next quarter. Another promising lead fell through because they preferred a local candidate in New York City, and he shared that lead with the broader group.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Michael provided a status update on his client pipeline but did not state any specific actions or goals he planned to undertake in the coming week.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

(N/A)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Michael Fantastic news on securing the advisory client for next quarter! That's a great win to have locked in.

> 
> To keep the momentum going, here are a few ideas:
> 
> • 🤝 Follow up with 3 promising leads from your pipeline

### John Fitzpatrick CTOx

**What They Discussed:**

John has been deeply engaged with a client, successfully solving a complex technical issue by using AI tools to discover undocumented features in Adobe Illustrator. He is also architecting a new real-time data automation system for the client's manufacturing floor. In parallel, he is building his own app to generate and manage LinkedIn campaigns, which he plans to use to launch his rebranded business and new niche focus.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Start his week-long business launch campaign on LinkedIn.

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

He clearly states his intention to launch the campaign, but the timing is not firm ("this week or at the latest next"), indicating he hasn't committed to a specific start date.

**Exact Quote:**

"with how things are running right now, I should be able to start doing the stuff this week or at the latest next. Early next week."

**Timestamp:**

(1h 2m 34s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

“Launch Day 1 of my 7-day rebranding campaign on LinkedIn” OR “Finalize and schedule all 7 posts for my launch campaign.”

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @John That story about using AI to find undocumented Adobe tags was incredible! Such a great example of high-level problem-solving.
> 
> I noticed you didn't lock in a firm, **quantifiable goal** for launching your rebrand campaign. It sounds like you're right on the cusp, which is super exciting.
> 
> Here are a few options to make it official:
> 
> • 🚀 Publish the first 2 posts of your 7-day launch campaign
> 
> • ✅ Finalize and schedule all 7 posts for the campaign

> 
> Want me to hold you accountable to one of these to ensure the launch happens?

### Donny Grover

**What They Discussed:**

As a new member, Donny is focused on following the program's structure. He had a very positive meeting with a potential client and is now preparing his first proposal. His main challenge is to clearly distinguish his fractional CTO services from the standard web development work the client also needs, ensuring he positions himself as a strategic leader rather than just a service provider.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Keep focused on educating himself and following the CTO plan to correctly structure his proposal.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

### Jeremie Kilgore

**What They Discussed:**

Jeremie has been focused on "network activations" by reconnecting with old contacts, including a friend from high school in medical sales. He has also used Apollo to generate a list of 100-150 prospects for cold outreach. He created a LinkedIn post based on an Amazon paper targeting credit unions, summarizing his past week as planning and the upcoming week as action-oriented.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Push out his outreach and get calls scheduled

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment has a time reference ("this next week") but lacks a specific, measurable count. "Those things" and "those calls" are vague phrases that don't define a clear target.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm going to push those things out, hopefully get those calls to happen in this next week, connecting with those folks."

**Timestamp:**

(20m 1s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send the first outreach email to 25 people from my Apollo list" OR "Schedule 2 calls with contacts from my existing network."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Jeremie Great job getting your Apollo list organized and a new LinkedIn post drafted—that's awesome prep work!
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. It sounds like you're right on the edge of moving from planning to action, which is a perfect time to lock in a target.
> 
> Here are a few options to get the ball rolling:
> 
> • ✉️ Send the first outreach message to 25 people on your Apollo list
> 
> • 📞 Schedule 2 calls with existing network contacts

He's also collaborating with Paul and John on their joint venture, with meetings planned to define their process. Additionally, he shared that he is working on a side project with a company called Altitude 80, focused on AI and legacy code modernization.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Continue network outreach and meet with his partners

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

"Continue to drive" is an ongoing activity without a specific, measurable outcome or numerical target for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"And then I'm going to continue to drive my network outreach continue to kind of play that that side of the coin."

**Timestamp:**

(22m 28s)

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Will The AI modernization project with Altitude 80 sounds fascinating, and it's great that you're leveling up your one-pager with more detail.
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for your outreach on the call. Totally understandable with so many moving pieces, but a specific target can help keep that flywheel spinning.
> 
> Here are a few options for next week:
> 
> • 🤝 Reach out to 5 new contacts in your network
> 
> • 💬 Follow up with 10 existing contacts
> 
> • 📄 Finalize and share the new back page of your one-pager with 2 people for feedback
>

### Mark Alcazar

**What They Discussed:**

Mark had a productive meeting with a VC who gave him valuable feedback on his pitch and a new idea to pursue. The VC suggested he create an AI adoption survey for companies and offered to share it with his portfolio of 50 companies. Mark is excited about this and plans to make it his top priority.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Build the AI adoption survey

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal has a specific, verifiable deliverable ("get it done," referring to the survey) and a clear time reference ("next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"So that's my top goal for next week, is to get it done."

**Timestamp:**

(25m 10s)

### Mack Earnhardt | Agile Reasoning

**What They Discussed:**

Mack shared his feelings of being stuck and struggling with focus due to "problems between my ears." He found a recent conversation with Marissa very helpful, as she provided clarity based on his Colby profile. He feels he has "lost the plot" on what to do next and is looking forward to a follow-up call with her and an upcoming workshop titled "Clients by Christmas."

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

He explicitly stated that he has "lost the plot" and is unsure what his commitments should be, indicating he is waiting for more clarity before setting a goal.

**Timestamp:**

(31m 47s)

"Attend the 'Clients by Christmas' workshop and identify 1 actionable takeaway" OR "Draft 1 potential outreach message based on insights from my call with Marissa."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mack Major props for talking with Marissa and getting that clarity from your Colby profile—that's a huge step forward when you're feeling stuck.

### jonbenedict

**What They Discussed:**

Jonbenedict is collaborating with Will and Paul to create a "playbook" for their healthcare offering, drawing from his recent work at a hospital. He shared a detailed story about navigating a challenging client situation involving a director creating a culture of fear and serious security lapses, such as finding passwords saved in plain text. He also mentioned he moved apartments to get reliable Wi-Fi.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

1. Deliver his playbook/deliverables draft to Will and Paul for review.
2. Publish one LinkedIn post.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

He made two distinct commitments, both of which are quantifiable. The first has a clear deliverable (the playbook draft) and a deadline ("next week"). The second has a specific count ("a LinkedIn piece") and a deadline ("this week").

**Exact Quote:**

"for next week, I think what we'll do is I'll deliver to Will and Paul kind of what I've done here so we can review..." and "And I do need to do a LinkedIn piece this week."

Here is the goal extraction analysis from the mastermind call.

### Alex Rodriguez

**What They Discussed:**

Alex shared that he has been actively networking with former peers, which he finds inspiring and validating for his fractional CTO path. He had a networking call today and has another scheduled for tomorrow. He is struggling with nailing his specific niche and crafting his story, but feels these networking conversations are helping him recall his unique skills and serve as a sounding board. He also shared a specific marketing GPT prompt with the group to help them articulate their value.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Work on his niche, website, and domains.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to make that "my thing for this next week" is vague. It refers to a collection of activities (nailing the niche, setting up the website) but doesn't specify a concrete, measurable outcome.

**Exact Quote:**

"So I've been trying to do that. That'll be my thing for this yeah, next week."

**Timestamp:**

(51m 15s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Draft the copy for my website's homepage" OR "Use the marketing GPT prompt to create a 'value resume' draft and share it with 1 person for feedback."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Alex Awesome to hear the networking calls are going so well—it's inspiring to see you pounding the pavement and getting that validation! Loved that you shared that marketing GPT prompt with the group, too.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. It's totally understandable when you're in that tough phase of nailing down your niche and story.
>
> To keep the momentum going, here are a few options you could lock in:
>
> • ✍️ Draft the copy for your website's homepage.
>
> • 📄 Use the marketing GPT to create 1 "value resume" artifact.
>
> • 📞 Schedule 2 more networking calls to continue testing your niche ideas.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Brett Gass

**What They Discussed:**

Brett explained that he is coming out of a six-year retirement and his return to work has been incredibly fast. His first two outreach calls to his network resulted in two fractional CTO jobs, one with his former company (Carbon Revolution) and another with an electric motorcycle startup. He discussed his deep experience in the automotive industry, his past struggles with work-life balance, and his current focus on setting firm boundaries. He also shared that he has another call planned to explore a collaboration.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Have his third outreach call with an old contact to discuss a collaboration.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal includes a specific count (one call, his "third") and a clear time reference ("next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"But we're doing that next week, I think, so that'll be my third call."

**Timestamp:**

(26m 51s)

---

### Rhett Ward

**What They Discussed:**

Rhett shared that he is trying to re-engage with the program after struggling to balance his full-time CIO job and family commitments. He is finding it difficult to establish a "laser focus" for his niche, as his experience is broad, even within his primary maritime industry. He had a call with a coach (Donna) to help craft his story and is concerned about managing his online presence while still employed. He plans to reset his "flight plan" to get back on track.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Schedule a call with Marco to redo his flight plan.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While the action is clear ("schedule a call"), it lacks a specific time reference. There is an intent to do it, but no deadline was set, making it a vague commitment.

**Exact Quote:**

"I am going to schedule a call with Marco, you know."

**Timestamp:**

(51m 23s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Schedule the call with Marco by the end of this week" OR "Complete the flight plan call with Marco before our next check-in."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Rhett Great job re-engaging and having that call with Donna to move things forward! It takes real effort to carve out time when you're balancing a demanding CIO role and family.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. Totally get it—it sounds like your main focus is getting reorganized and finding that laser focus.
>
> Here are a few options to help you lock in that next step:
>
> • 🗓️ Schedule the call with Marco by Friday.
>
> • 📝 Watch the storytelling session Alex mentioned and write down 3 key takeaways for your own story.
>
> • 🎯 Draft a single sentence that defines a potential "laser focus" niche to test.
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Mehmet

**What They Discussed:**

Mehmet shared an update on a potential fractional CTO role with an early-stage EV car company. The client offered a low monthly payment ($5,000) but included company shares. Mehmet is hesitant due to the high commitment required, the current downturn in the EV market, the company's lack of a market-ready product, and manufacturing being in China, which poses tariff risks. He is weighing this risky offer and has sought advice from the group.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

Mehmet is waiting for feedback from his mentor, Lior, before deciding how to proceed with the offer. He mentions he will "probably" look for another client, but this is conditional on the outcome of his discussion and not a firm commitment.

**Exact Quote:**

"I scheduled a call with Lior to ask his opinion, too, and then, yeah, probably I'll be looking for another client."

**Timestamp:**

(26m 12s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Make a final decision (accept, counter, or decline) on the EV company offer by the end of the week" OR "Send outreach messages to 3 new potential clients."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mehmet That was a really insightful breakdown of that complex EV company offer. It’s smart that you’re weighing the risks vs. the equity and have a call scheduled with Lior to get another perspective.
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. It makes total sense, as you're waiting on that key conversation before making a move.
> 
> To help you maintain momentum after that call, here are a few options:
> 
> • 📧 Send a final decision (counter, decline, etc.) to the EV company
> 
> • 🎯 Identify 5 new companies to target for outreach
> 
> • ✍️ Draft 1 new cold outreach template
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Ajay Chankramath

**What They Discussed:**

Ajay provided an update on his deal flow, mentioning he closed a third deal last week and another one is set to begin on November 13th. He is currently working on two new opportunities: a broader proposal for an existing client and a new proposal for an edtech company struggling with its Google Cloud transformation. He also shared that he will be traveling to Turkey and Poland to speak at conferences, network, and promote his new book.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Put together a proposal for the edtech company.

**Classification:**

✅ Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a measurable count (one proposal) and a clear time reference ("over the next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"My goal over the next week is going to be to put together a proposal for them."

**Timestamp:**

(28m 28s)

### William

**What They Discussed:**

William shared his frustration with his current outreach efforts, noting that despite sending hundreds of cold emails weekly, he isn't getting traction. He feels he's making progress but isn't seeing the "fruits of his labor," which is causing him to struggle with what to focus on. He is considering offering a free, high-value audit (like a security or acquisition audit) to get his foot in the door but is unsure how to position or offer it.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

🚫 No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

William explicitly stated he is struggling to figure out what to focus on. He discussed several ideas he's thinking about, such as offering free audits or posting on LinkedIn, but did not commit to taking any specific action in the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

"I won't have to sit down and think about what I'm going to work on this week because I read a lot of stuff that's just working in the background. But I need something to, for this group to show that I'm continuing to work on it."

**Timestamp:**

(48m 53s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Draft the outreach message for the acquisition audit and send it to 1 person" OR "Attend the 2 upcoming networking events and make 3 new connections at each."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @William Great to have you back, and kudos for keeping the outreach engine running even while traveling! It's completely understandable to feel frustrated when you’re putting in that much effort without seeing the results you want.
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t lock in a **quantifiable goal** on the call. It sounds like you're in a tough spot trying to decide which lever to pull next.

> Based on the great ideas you floated, here are a few small, concrete actions to test what works:
> 
> • 💡 Draft 1 version of your 'free acquisition audit' outreach message

### Blake Lindsay

**What They Discussed:**

Blake shared his recent success with a LinkedIn post about toxic leadership that he created using Claude, which received great engagement. He also spoke enthusiastically about a recent AI session where he was put in the "hot seat" and learned how to build custom GPTs to find sales leads. This discovery energized him, and he now plans to use these new AI skills to refine his lead generation process and connect with potential clients.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Work on refining his AI lead generation query and continue posting on LinkedIn.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "work on" the query and "continue" posting is vague. It lacks specific numbers (e.g., number of leads to find, number of posts to make) to measure completion.

**Exact Quote:**

"anyways, I'll work on that and I don't know, there's no deliverable for that, but... And I'll still continue doing my LinkedIn posting."

**Timestamp:**

(35m 16s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

“Use the custom GPT to generate a list of 10 qualified leads” OR “Publish 3 new posts on LinkedIn this week.”

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Blake It was awesome to hear how fired up you were after figuring out the custom GPTs—that’s a huge win and a powerful new tool for you!
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** on the call. Totally understandable, since you're in a heavy exploration and learning phase with this new tech.

> • 🎯 Use your new custom GPT to generate a list of 10 qualified leads.
> • ✍️ Publish 3 new posts on LinkedIn.

### Andrew G

**What They Discussed:**

Andrew has been focusing on refining his marketing outreach. After getting feedback from Donna that his emails were being opened but not getting replies, he used Claude to generate two different four-email sequences. He is currently iterating on these drafts with Donna and aims to launch an A/B test soon. He is also continuing with networking calls but is working on better articulating his value proposition to avoid confusion.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Get to a point where he can launch his email A/B tests this week.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal has a clear time reference ("this week") and a measurable outcome. He previously defined the A/B test as sending each of the two email sequences to 100 people, making the action specific and trackable.

**Exact Quote:**

"Ideally, I'm going to get to a point this week where I can actually do those AB tests."

**Timestamp:**

(42m 47s)

### David Brumbaugh

**What They Discussed:**

David reported that he has no trouble securing meetings and warm leads within his niche of Christian businesses. He is focused on building a payment processing platform to serve as an alternative to Stripe for conservatives and Christians. He is currently providing pro-bono strategic work to potential partners to build relationships and secure future revenue, including a significant deal with a film studio that he expects to generate six figures.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

### Amanda Kabak

**What They Discussed:**

Amanda shared a big win of attending her first in-person networking event, which was a significant step for her. She also provided an update on her progress, mentioning that her network activation has been slow but has resulted in good conversations. She landed a major opportunity to be a contract CTO for a nonprofit focused on sustainability startups, which aligns perfectly with her niche and personal mission, even if the pay isn't top-tier.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Launch her first LinkedIn outreach sequence in Sales Robot.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "have it go live soon" has a clear action but lacks a specific deadline, making the time reference vague.

**Exact Quote:**

"So I'm playing around with the messaging there and I'll have it go live soon, see if I can get some connections in."

**Timestamp:**

(56m 8s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Launch the Sales Robot sequence and send connection requests to 50 local software companies by Friday" OR "Finalize the messaging for my Sales Robot sequence and launch it by Wednesday."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

### Camilo Martinez

**What They Discussed:**

Camilo shared that he also attended a BNI networking event to get the ball rolling on lead generation. He is exploring a strategy to offer AI-powered website builds as a low-cost entry point to then upsell clients to his fractional CTO services. He emphasized the importance of playing the long game by building a personal brand through content like videos and blogs to establish his online presence over time.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Work on rewriting pricing models, reach out to new leads, and create content.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment is a collection of vague intentions. Phrases like "rewrite some," "reach out to multiple," and "doing some posts" lack specific numbers and clear, singular outcomes.

**Exact Quote:**

"Doing some posts, reaching out to some of the leads that I got this morning, talk with them, make meetings, and see what they have."

**Timestamp:**

(55m 20s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Reach out to 5 new leads from the BNI meeting to schedule discovery calls" OR "Create and post 1 video about the AWS outage and share it on LinkedIn."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Camilo Martinez Awesome job getting out to that BNI event to make new connections! It sounds like you have a ton of great ideas for building momentum.
> 
> 
> During the call, I noticed you didn’t set a specific **quantifiable goal** for the week. It’s easy to do when you're juggling so many different initiatives!
> 
> To help focus that great energy, here are a few options you could lock in:
> 
> • 📞 Reach out to all the leads you met at the BNI event
> 
> • ✍️ Publish 1 blog post from your video content
> 
> • 💰 Finalize and update the 3 pricing tiers on your website
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

George offered advice on using low-effort "lead magnets" to get a foot in the door with potential clients. He detailed his "Traffic, Conversion, Automation" framework, stressing the importance of building a sales pipeline before focusing on content creation. He's currently managing a referral channel that sends varied leads and recently hired a project manager to help him establish better boundaries, sharing a past experience of firing all his clients to restart his practice and avoid burnout. He also shared a detailed demo of an AI platform he's building with Codex to assist him during sales calls.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Create a plan to transition a current client from a small "gatekeeper project" to a much larger retainer.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

**Timestamp:**

(55m 53s)

### Pankil Patel

**What They Discussed:**

Pankil was an active listener, asking George clarifying questions about his business model, how long he has been in the program, and the specific automation tools he uses (like Agent Kit and Codex).

### Joel

**What They Discussed:**

Joel shared an update on his recent solo trip to Iceland. He then discussed a recent proposal review with a potential client that he decided not to pursue. Key red flags were the CEO's absence from the meeting and the company's rush to select an ERP system without proper strategy, which Joel felt signaled a "move fast and break things" culture he wants to avoid.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Watch a video on the "100 cups" outreach method and start to operationalize it.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While watching the video this week is a clear task, the commitment to "operationalize it" is vague and lacks a specific, measurable outcome.

**Exact Quote:**

"That's going to be one of my things this week is to get to that and operationalize it, if you will"

**Timestamp:**

(1h 11m 32s)

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

### Tim Faith

**What They Discussed:**

Tim shared that he was inspired to start marketing himself as a fractional CTO. His first outreach effort last week led to a promising response, but he now feels challenged to figure out the right next steps to convert the opportunity. He is also reflecting on whether the potential work aligns with his desire to do strategic CTO work versus more hands-on architect work.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Do five outreaches to his network.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal includes a specific number ("five") and an implied timeframe ("next week," based on the context of the meeting).

**Exact Quote:**

"...and then I'll have a goal for, you know, putting out, you know, doing the five outreaches."

### Christian Wiles

**What They Discussed:**

Christian is feeling a strong need to pivot. His primary client is in a declining industry and signaling contractor cuts, and he feels his 15-year focus on the Keep CRM ecosystem has become a professional dead end. He is currently in a "discovery mode," exploring a new consultancy focused on marketing/sales operations strategy, potentially using tools like Google Analytics, Looker Studio, and AI.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

Christian explicitly stated he is in "discovery mode" and is still trying to figure out his next move. He has not yet decided on a specific action.

**Exact Quote:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during the call, which makes total sense given you're in discovery mode.
> 
> To help turn exploration into action, here are a few potential next steps:

Shannon introduced himself as a new member with over 30 years of IT experience. He identified his superpower as bridging the communication gap between technical teams and the C-suite. His expertise lies in cloud and data center migrations, particularly for mid-sized manufacturing and oil & gas companies, and he is now exploring AI and legacy modernization.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal / Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

As a new member, Shannon was focused on introducing himself and his background. He is still in the process of defining a specific niche and did not set an action item for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"I haven't picked a niche yet..."

**Timestamp:**

(1h 4m 41s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Update your LinkedIn headline to reflect your fractional CTO focus on legacy modernization" OR "Research the top 3 business challenges for downstream oil & gas companies" OR "Schedule a 1-on-1 intro call with one other member of this group."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Shannon Welcome to the group! It was great to hear about your background—your ability to translate tech for the C-suite is a true superpower.
> 
> 
> Since you're just getting started, you naturally didn't set a **quantifiable goal**. To help you hit the ground running, here are a few small first steps you could take:

> 
> • 🧭 Research the top 3 challenges facing downstream oil & gas companies.

### Matthew Butler

**What They Discussed:**

Matthew primarily contributed by sharing his experience with the "100 cups" networking method. He explained that by focusing on genuine conversation rather than selling, he has built relationships that naturally lead to opportunities. He gave two recent examples where casual conversations led to valuable referrals and potential client work, reinforcing the idea that taking the pressure off a sales outcome yields the best results.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Matthew was sharing his wisdom and past successes to help Joel. He did not discuss his own current challenges or set a goal for the upcoming week.

### Brent Nowak

**What They Discussed:**

Brent explained he will be on a completely unplugged retreat until the 29th and won't be working. He shared his experience with the CTOX program, expressing regret for starting his "flight plan" too early before his assets were ready. He then asked for and received a detailed, screen-share tutorial from Keith on setting up email automation in CRMX, as he was previously doing it manually. He also discussed a potential coaching opportunity for a client whose CTO is struggling to manage a rapidly growing software team.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Brent explicitly stated he will be on an unplugged retreat with no access to electronics, making a professional commitment for the upcoming week impossible.

**Exact Quote:**

"I mean, I'm literally going to be gone through Monday on. On a retreat where I unplug from all electronics"

**Timestamp:**

(58m 52s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

A goal could be set for upon his return, such as "Set up 1 email automation workflow in CRMX using what I learned" or "Send a follow-up email to my contact about the CTO coaching opportunity."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Brent That unplugged retreat sounds amazing and much-needed! Great to hear you’re taking time to recharge.
> 
> 
> Obviously no goal for this week while you’re off the grid, but I wanted to capture the momentum from your CRMX session with Keith.
> 
> How about we lock in a goal for when you get back? Here are a couple of ideas:
> 
> • ⚙️ Create your first 3-email template sequence in CRMX
> 
> • 📧 Set up 1 automated workflow and test it with your own email
> 
> • 📞 Schedule the 2-hour discovery workshop with the potential CTO coaching client
> 
> Want me to hold you accountable to one of these for our next check-in? Enjoy the retreat!

### Keith Piccininno

**What They Discussed:**

Keith discussed his financial situation, noting he hasn't had a paycheck since February and is relying on cold marketing, which is a struggle. He explained he has moved to a cheaper "essentials" plan with his coaching program to stay connected to the network. He has one proposal currently out with a follow-up meeting scheduled for tomorrow. He spent a significant portion of the call providing a detailed, screen-share tutorial to Brent on how to set up email automation and templates in the CRMX platform.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Continue his LinkedIn posts and cold outreach.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "continue" his efforts is vague. It lacks a specific number of posts to create or outreach messages to send, making it impossible to measure completion.

**Exact Quote:**

"Mine's... I'm just continuing my LinkedIn post, continuing my cold outreach."

**Timestamp:**

(58m 58s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Publish 2 new LinkedIn posts" or "Send 15 personalized cold outreach emails."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Keith Best of luck with your meeting tomorrow—fingers crossed for you! And that CRMX walkthrough you gave Brent was fantastic, super valuable stuff.
> 
> 
> I noticed on the call you committed to "continuing" your outreach and posts, but didn't set a **quantifiable goal**. With everything on your plate, having a clear number can help focus your energy.
> 
> A few options to make it concrete for next week:
> 
> • ✍️ Publish 2 LinkedIn posts (maybe one on that AWS outage David mentioned?)
> 
> • 📧 Send 15 new cold outreach emails
> 
> • 🎯 Identify 20 new prospects to add to your pipeline
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for our next check-in?

### David Taiwo

**What They Discussed:**

David shared that his CTOX program membership ends in October and he is planning to switch to the limited "essentials" plan to save money, as he hasn't landed a consulting gig yet. He talked about the mindset shift required for fractional work and the personal journey of learning to market himself. He then shared a very detailed and effective process for batch-creating weeks of LinkedIn content using a combination of Claude, ChatGPT, and his resume to generate personalized, thought-provoking posts.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Post his next LinkedIn post today.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal is specific, measurable, and time-bound. It includes a clear action (post), a quantity (one post), and a definite timeframe ("right now" / "today").

**Exact Quote:**

"So I'm going to post it right now."

**Timestamp:**

### Tony Winter

**What They Discussed:**

Tony shared his frustration with being ghosted by a promising CEO prospect after several weeks of positive interactions. He's managing three opportunities: the one ghosting him, a workshop that was delayed by a week, and a new, very positive meeting with a fast-growing fractional-friendly company. He plans to follow up on the ghosting situation through an alternate contact and is refining his niche to focus on longer-term outreach to software/SaaS companies, though he finds it slow going.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Tony provided a detailed status update on his pipeline and current activities but did not state a specific, actionable commitment for the upcoming week. He mentioned ongoing processes like going "back through the network again" but set no clear target.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Follow up with the alternate contact at the ghosting company by Wednesday" OR "Identify 10 new SaaS companies for my cold outreach list."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. Totally get it; juggling a delayed workshop and a ghosting prospect is a lot to handle.
>
> Here are a few options you could lock in to keep momentum going:
>
> • 📞 Ping that alternate contact at the company that’s ghosting you
>
> • 🎯 Identify 10 new SaaS companies for your cold portfolio
>
> • ✅ Follow up with the workshop client to confirm the new date
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Anthony Jones

**What They Discussed:**

Anthony recounted a difficult outreach interaction that highlighted the challenge of getting prospects' guards down. He is seeing a 25% connection rate on his LinkedIn campaign to C-level executives in the hospice space but is now focused on turning those connections into conversations. His main update was the launch of his new AI-driven app, "wellTrack," a free tool designed to combat staff burnout in hospice agencies, which he will use as a value-add and a conversation starter.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Send outreach messages to 5-10 connections this week.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a measurable count ("5 or 6, maybe 10") and a clear time reference ("a week"), meeting both criteria for being quantifiable.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'll probably just send maybe like 5 or 6, maybe 10 a week or something like that and just see how that all works out."

**Timestamp:**

(27m 15s)

---

### Chris Étienne

**What They Discussed:**

Chris shared that his LinkedIn outreach yields a good connection rate (around 20-30%), but he struggles to get responses to his follow-up messages. To build rapport, he has started engaging with his prospects' content. He also announced that he made his first-ever video post on LinkedIn while at the Dreamforce conference, which has boosted his confidence to create more video content. His main focus for the upcoming week is attending a B2B Finance Expo in Las Vegas to increase his visibility.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Increase presence and visibility within his target niche.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "increase presence and visibility" is a high-level objective, not a specific, measurable action. It lacks a clear number or a verifiable outcome for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"For me it's really just increasing my presence and visibility within my target niche, creating more content, starting on a newsletter."

**Timestamp:**

(34m 7s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Connect with 10 new people at the Vegas conference" OR "Publish 1 new video post on LinkedIn" OR "Outline the first 3 topics for my new newsletter."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Chris Congrats on getting over the video bug and posting from Dreamforce! That's a huge step for visibility.
>
> I noticed your goals for next week were focused on the big picture, like increasing visibility. Totally makes sense, especially with the big B2B Finance Expo coming up in Vegas.
>
> To make it more concrete, here are a few options you could lock in:
>
> • 🤝 Connect with 10 new people at the Vegas expo
>
> • 📹 Publish 1 new video post this week
>
> • 📝 Outline the first 3 topics for your new newsletter

### Joel Key

**What They Discussed:**

Joel has been focused on refining his messaging and has spent time rewriting his one-pager based on feedback. He's shifted his positioning from tactical support to a more strategic offer: helping seed-stage hard tech startups connect effectively with enterprise partners. He mentioned this new messaging seems to be resonating better. He also has a workshop offer out on LinkedIn and is planning to develop the template for it.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Work through a workshop template.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The phrase "work through a workshop template" is vague. It doesn't specify a clear deliverable or outcome (e.g., first draft complete, outline finished), making it impossible to measure completion.

**Exact Quote:**

"...work through a workshop template and that's kind of where I'm exploring this week and play with next week."

**Timestamp:**

(37m 46s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the first draft of the workshop template" OR "Outline the 3 main sections of the workshop" OR "Get feedback on the workshop concept from 2 peers."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Joel Rewriting your one-pager to focus on strategy is a big win! It's great that the new messaging is resonating better.
>
> On the call, your goal was to "work through a workshop template." I get it—figuring out the specifics of a new offer can be an exploratory process.
>
> To help create some tangible momentum, here are a few options:

> • ✍️ Complete the first draft of the workshop template
>
> • 🧭 Outline the 3 main sections of the workshop

### Filip Szalewicz

**What They Discussed:**

Filip feels confident in his cold email process and is now shifting his focus entirely to LinkedIn outreach. He believes the key to success is approaching other founders with "founder energy"—connecting as a peer who is also building something. This strategy has already resulted in meaningful conversations. He validated his new client acquisition flywheel by signing a new client, who starts November 1st, from completely outside his personal network.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Start focusing on LinkedIn outreach with "founder energy."

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "start this for real" and "go in heavy on that" describes an intention and a strategic shift rather than a specific, measurable goal for the upcoming week. It lacks a quantifiable target.

**Exact Quote:**

"So I will go in heavy on that." (referring to his founder energy outreach approach)

**Timestamp:**

(54m 25s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send 5 highly-personalized 'founder energy' connection requests" OR "Identify 10 founders who fit my new outreach criteria" OR "Draft my core 'founder energy' outreach message template."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Filip Huge congrats on landing the new client from outside your network! That's incredible validation for your flywheel strategy.
>
> I noticed your commitment for next week was to "go in heavy" on the founder energy outreach. It makes total sense to be focused on the big strategy, especially after such a big win and with a new client starting.
>
> To kickstart that focus, here are a few measurable options:
>
> • 🚀 Send 5 highly-personalized 'founder energy' connection requests
>
> • 🎯 Identify 10 founders who fit your new outreach criteria
>
> • ✍️ Draft the core message template for your 'founder energy' approach
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Venkat Vellaichamy

**What They Discussed:**

Venkat is currently moving to Austin for the next year to get settled and focus on his business. He reported progress on generating a batch of LinkedIn content using AI, creating a content strategy, and polishing his one-pager. He also began activating his network to test his fractional CTO niche, receiving mixed feedback on targeting general contractors versus small hospitals.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Settle in Austin and follow a rigorous schedule to catch up on lagging items.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment is about logistics (moving) and a general intention ("follow on on the things that I was lagging") rather than a specific, measurable business action. It lacks a clear number or deliverable.

**Exact Quote:**

"My plan is to go to Austin, settle down there, and then on Monday, meet the team on the dinner that the CDOX team scheduled and then to the rigorous schedule so I can, you know, follow on on the things that I was lagging until now."

**Timestamp:**

(20m 21s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Post 2 of the LinkedIn posts I generated" OR "Follow up with 3 people from my network who gave feedback on my niche."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

>
> I noticed on the call you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. Totally understandable with the move happening!

### Jeremie Kilgore

**What They Discussed:**

Jeremie shared that his sole focus has been on network activation, which involves making connections and scheduling calls. He feels his website and LinkedIn profile are ready, so he is concentrating his efforts on direct outreach. He mentioned using a tool called Scribe to help rewrite a hook for a story, demonstrating his focus on improving his messaging for this outreach.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Jeremie described his current focus area ("the only thing right now that I'm pushing") but did not commit to a specific, forward-looking action or target for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

"that's the only thing right now that I'm pushing... The meat and potatoes right now is I'm trying to make it, those connections."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Jeremie Love the laser focus on network activation—that's exactly where the leverage is right now. Smart move to make that the main thing.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. It’s easy to do when you're deep in the work!
>
> To help track that great progress, here are a few options:
>
> • 📞 Schedule 2 new network activation calls
> • 🔗 Send 10 new connection requests to people on your golden list
> • 💬 Reach out to 5 existing contacts to test your new story hook
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Mark Alcazar

**What They Discussed:**

Mark shared that he finally had a breakthrough in understanding the cold outreach methodology after a recent session. He is moving forward with a promising sales proposal for a VP of Engineering, which has now been passed to the CEO. Inspired by a conversation with Marissa, he plans to start a podcast to support his business development efforts.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Record a screen test for his new podcast and schedule his first guest.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes two distinct, measurable actions ("record screen test," "schedule first guest") with a clear time frame ("next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"My goal for next week is to I record... my... screen test of myself. Just explain what the podcast is... and then I'm hoping to schedule my first guest as well."

**Timestamp:**

(28m 39s)

### Will May

**What They Discussed:**

Will's primary focus has been developing a partnership framework with John Benedict and Paul McCrae to target the healthcare niche. He has been iterating on the framework with John and has a meeting scheduled with both partners immediately following this call to finalize their strategy and "put our stake in the ground."

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Next actions will be determined in the partnership meeting happening after this call.

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

Will clearly stated that his next actions are contingent on the outcome of an upcoming meeting. He has not yet committed to a specific personal goal for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"Probably, you know, best next actions or next actions or whatever should be coming out of this meeting."

**Timestamp:**

(25m 4s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

Once the meeting is over, a goal could be: "Complete my 3 assigned action items from the partnership strategy session" OR "Send 5 outreach messages targeting the new healthcare niche."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Will Great to hear about the progress on the partnership framework for the healthcare niche! It sounds like you guys are ready to make a big move.
>
> On the call, you mentioned your next actions would be decided in your meeting right after.
>
> How about once you nail down that plan, you drop your **quantifiable goal** for the week in the channel? A couple of ideas could be:
>
> • 🎯 Complete my top 2 action items from our strategy meeting
> • 📞 Conduct 1 joint outreach call with a partner
>
> Let us know what you decide so we can hold you to it!

### Mack Earnhardt | Agile Reasoning

**What They Discussed:**

Mack shared that he had been feeling overwhelmed and spread too thin, causing him to neglect exercise and feel unhappy with his website progress. He recognized this was a pattern of self-criticism and that he needed to refocus on high-value activities. He committed to finally booking his overdue strategy call with Marissa to get moving again with consistency.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Book the strategy time with Marissa.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal is a single, specific action ("booking that time with Marissa") to be completed within a clear time frame ("this week").

**Exact Quote:**

"But for this week, I think going ahead now and booking that time with Marissa would probably be a good thing."

**Timestamp:**

(30m 28s)

### Jon Benedict

**What They Discussed:**

Jon is back from a week of PTO in Austin and feeling disconnected from his business-building activities. He is moving to a new apartment with high-speed internet, which he expects will enable him to catch up. His priorities are to overhaul his one-pager and website to better reflect his new "business impact first" messaging, finish his network activation, and schedule his velocity call with Marissa.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Get several large items done this week, including overhauling his website and one-pager and scheduling his call with Marissa.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While the commitment has a time frame ("this week"), the core tasks like "overhaul my one pager" and "overhaul my website" are too vague and large to be measured. They lack specific deliverables.

**Exact Quote:**

"So I'll get all those things done this week."

**Timestamp:**

(46m 5s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Rewrite the headline and services section of my one-pager" OR "Draft the new copy for my website's homepage" OR "Schedule the velocity call with Marissa by Friday."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Jon Welcome back! Glad you got some time off, and congrats on the apartment upgrade to gig speed—that's a game-changer.
>
> I heard you say your goal is to get "all those things done this week." Totally get the urge to catch up fast!
>
> To make that more manageable and **quantifiable**, how about we lock in one or two specific pieces of the puzzle? For example:
>
> • 📝 Rewrite the headline and services section of your one-pager
> • 💻 Draft the new copy for your website's homepage
> • 🗓️ Get the velocity call with Marissa on the calendar
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Will May

**What They Discussed:**

Will provided an update on John, who is dealing with significant technical debt and infrastructure issues at his client's site, likening it to time-traveling 15 years into the past. This situation has sparked a collaboration between Will and John to target the healthcare niche, specifically smaller regional hospitals. They are developing a formal partnership framework and plan to meet with a third-party sales expert to discuss how they can team up to market their combined skills and grow the business.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Review the partnership framework and meet with their potential third partner.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a specific, measurable action ("a meeting") and a clear time reference ("next week"), making it a verifiable outcome.

**Exact Quote:**

"John's actually going to send me the framework that we discussed last night, and I'm going to add to it, and we're going to be having a meeting next week with this third party to see how that that, if they throw up on it, or they say, Yeah, I like this."

### Mark Alcazar

**What They Discussed:**

Mark had a very positive week, highlighted by a successful call with a CEO and VP of Engineering that led to him creating a Statement of Work for a strategic consulting engagement. He also continued his network activation, reaching third-order contacts through referrals. A significant update was his adoption of Apollo for outreach, which he found effective and is now using to automate his LinkedIn efforts.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Continue LinkedIn outreach with Apollo and start "peddling" value to new connections.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment expresses clear intent but lacks specific numbers. "Continue doing" and "start peddling" are actions without a measurable quantity, making it impossible to verify completion.

**Exact Quote:**

"this week. I'm planning to continue doing that, and then I'm planning to start what Leo calls peddling like, you know, giving something of value to the folks who've accepted, and then for the folks who did not accept, trying an email outreach via poking them..."

**Timestamp:**

(29:07)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send 25 new connection requests via Apollo" OR "Send a 'value peddle' message to 10 new connections" OR "Send 15 follow-up emails to prospects who haven't connected."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mark Fantastic progress on that SOW for the strategic consult—that's a huge step forward! It's also great to hear you've got Apollo up and running to streamline your outreach.
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during the call. Totally understandable, as it sounds like you're building a new system for outreach.
> 
> To help keep the momentum going, here are a few options you could lock in:
> 
> • 🎯 Send 25 new targeted connection requests via Apollo
> 
> • 🤝 Share a valuable insight (peddle) with 10 of your new connections
> 
> • 📧 Follow up with 15 prospects who didn't accept your initial request
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Jeremie Kilgore

**What They Discussed:**

Jeremie is on the verge of launching his new website, aiming to go live in the next day. He has been experimenting with Apollo for outreach and has identified a local list of around 200 potential contacts. He also has five pieces of LinkedIn content prepared and is now focused on planning the schedule for their release.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Go live with the website, connect with more leads from Apollo, and start pushing LinkedIn content.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While "go live with the website" is a clear action, the other two commitments ("connecting more with leads" and "pushing content") are vague and lack specific numbers. The overall goal is not measurable.

**Exact Quote:**

"the next steps are going live with the website, connecting more with the leads that I've gotten out of Apollo, and then pushing content for LinkedIn. Those are the three things that I'm focused on here this next week."

**Timestamp:**

(33:53)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Go live with the website by Tuesday," "Reach out to 20 new leads from my Apollo list," AND "Schedule and post 3 of my 5 prepared LinkedIn articles."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Jeremie Awesome to hear the website is ready to go live and that you have 5 content pieces prepped—that's a fantastic foundation for the week!
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a fully **quantifiable goal** during the call. It makes sense, as you're juggling a few big launch activities at once.
> 
> Here are a few concrete options to lock in that progress:
> 
> • 🚀 Go live with the website by EOD Wednesday
> 
> • 📬 Send initial outreach messages to 20 leads from your Apollo list
> 
> • ✍️ Schedule and post 3 of your 5 completed LinkedIn content pieces
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Venkat Vellaichamy

**What They Discussed:**

Venkat shared an interesting development from his AI course, where he's collaborating with a doctor on a capstone project in the OB/GYN space; he plans to meet with him on Friday to also pitch his fractional CTO services. He has a v0 of his website ready for feedback and has officially defined his next step as a "network activation sprint." His plan is to reach out to his existing contacts to generate leads for his two target niches: general contractors and small hospitals.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Reach out to his contacts as part of his network activation sprint.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "reach out to my contacts" is a clear action but lacks a specific number, making it difficult to measure completion.

**Exact Quote:**

"So I'm gonna looks like I need to do a network activation sprint. So I'm gonna reach out to my contacts that I'm telling them about this fractional secure stuff, and then and then eventually generate lead leads on the two niches that I'm gonna work on."

**Timestamp:**

(36:34)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Reach out to 15 contacts in my network to announce my fractional CTO services" OR "Have 3 conversations with contacts about potential referrals."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Venkat That capstone project with the doctor sounds like an amazing opportunity—great work creating that opening! It's also solid that you’ve officially defined your network activation sprint.
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for that sprint during our call. No worries, that first step of defining the sprint is the most important one.
> 
> To help you get rolling, here are a couple of options you could commit to:
> 
> • 📣 Reach out to 15 people in your network about your new focus
> 
> • 📞 Schedule 3 calls with contacts to discuss your fractional CTO services
> 
> • 🎯 Identify 20 key contacts to target for your two niches
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Ryan Sheehan

**What They Discussed:**

As a new member in his second week, Ryan shared that he is balancing a W2 job while also having just landed his first fractional CTO client on a retainer. He feels overwhelmed and like he has "no clue" what he's doing, trying to manage his new client, his job, and networking. He asked for advice on finding a niche, avoiding missteps, and the effectiveness of in-person versus online networking.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Ask his friend at Raytheon about their supply chain to help Brian.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This is a specific action item, but it is a task to help another member rather than a business goal for himself. It lacks a quantifiable metric related to his own client acquisition or business growth.

**Exact Quote:**

"Anyway, I'll ask the question because I do see the guy a lot. I see him pretty much every week."

**Timestamp:**

(41m 15s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Identify 5 potential new leads from my existing network" OR "Time-block 3 hours this week to complete the next module in the CTOX training."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Ryan Congrats on landing your first fractional client on a retainer—that's a massive win right out of the gate! 🚀
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for your own business during the call. Totally understandable, it sounds like you're juggling a ton right now and just getting your bearings.

>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Brian Dedischew

**What They Discussed:**

Brian shared his perspective as a one-year member, expressing regret for not going "full bore" into his fractional business from the start while balancing a demanding 60-80 hour work week. He detailed a major breakthrough in his networking, where a series of targeted, personal connections led him to the president of the A3 robotics organization, opening up a significant new market opportunity. He is now trying to hire a virtual assistant and rearrange his schedule to attend a key A3 conference.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Brian provided a detailed update on his current activities and challenges, such as "actively seeking" a VA and "trying to frantically figure out" his schedule. However, he did not state a specific, forward-looking commitment or deliverable to complete by the next call.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm actively seeking someone to go build my brand now." (This is a status update, not a commitment for the week).

**Timestamp:**

(17m 22s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Interview at least 2 candidates for the Virtual Assistant role" OR "Send personalized follow-up emails to the 5 new contacts from the A3 president."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Brian That connection with the president of A3 is a game-changer! Seriously impressive networking that proves your targeted approach works. 👏
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during our call. With the 80-hour weeks you're pulling, it's amazing you're making any progress at all.
>
> To help you capitalize on this momentum, what about one of these small but mighty goals?
>
> • 🤝 Send a follow-up/research summary to the A3 president
> • 🔍 Interview 2 candidates for your VA position
> • 🗓️ Draft a plan to delegate 3 tasks once the VA is hired
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Alex Rodriguez

**What They Discussed:**

Alex, who has been in the program for a month, is focusing on shifting his mindset at his W2 job to delegate more and operate like a fractional CTO. He believes his primary path to success is through intensive networking with his existing connections rather than focusing on marketing automation tools right now. He recently connected with a couple of CEOs and has a long-term goal of landing two or three clients through this networking effort.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Network his butt off.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment shows clear intent but is vague and lacks a specific number, count, or measurable outcome for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"But I think for now, I think this first, whatever, two, three months, I'm just going to try to just network my butt off and connect with all the folks that I've... That I've worked with..."

**Timestamp:**

(24m 12s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Reconnect with 10 former colleagues on LinkedIn" OR "Schedule 2 virtual coffee chats with contacts from my network."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Alex It's awesome to hear how you're actively changing your mindset and pushing back at your W2—that's the exact shift needed to succeed as a fractional. 💪
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for your networking. It's easy to get lost in the grind, so making it specific can really help.
>
> Here are a few options to lock in for the week:
>
> • 📧 Send personalized outreach messages to 10 former colleagues
> • ☕ Schedule 2 virtual coffee chats with promising contacts
> • 📌 Attend 1 local networking event (like the Snowflake one you mentioned)
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Ajay Chankramath (AJ)

**What They Discussed:**

AJ gave an update on several major wins, including finalizing a November 13 start date for a multi-cohort education program and signing a new, similar contract with Pearson. He is also managing two revived CTO-level conversations that had previously gone dormant. His primary challenge is now extreme time constraints, working 70-80 hour weeks to build course content and demos, and he's strategizing how he would manage a new fractional client on top of his current workload.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Finalize the start date for his course with Pearson.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal has a specific, verifiable outcome (1 date finalized) and a clear time reference ("over the next week"). It is a binary task that is either completed or not, which makes it measurable.

**Exact Quote:**

"But my goal over the next week is to finalize that date so that I can really start moving into building the content and all that kind of good stuff."

**Timestamp:**

(45m 12s)

### Konst Mroncz

**What They Discussed:**

Konst shared that he was about to cancel his LinkedIn outreach service (Vision leads) but they pivoted to a pay-per-appointment model which is now showing results, with three calls booked for the next day and a 28% connection acceptance rate. He has invested around $1,200 over two months and is cautiously optimistic, waiting to see if these appointments convert into actual business. He also expressed his general dislike for LinkedIn and AI-generated content.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Continue with his current LinkedIn outreach strategy.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "keep going down that path" is a continuation of an existing strategy but lacks a specific, measurable target or action for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

"I want to keep going down that path."

**Timestamp:**

(21m 14s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Hold the 3 booked calls and send follow-up proposals" OR "Analyze the results of this week's calls to decide whether to continue the service for another month."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Konst Great to hear the lead gen service is finally kicking into gear with a 28% acceptance rate and 3 calls booked! That's a promising turnaround.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. Totally understandable, since you're in a "wait-and-see" phase with this experiment.
>
> To keep the momentum, how about locking in one of these?
>
> • 📞 Conduct those 3 initial calls and document the outcomes
>
> • 📊 Create a simple tracker for appointments set vs. calls completed
>
> • 💡 Identify 1 key learning from the calls to refine the outreach script
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Paul Dalton

**What They Discussed:**

Paul's week was derailed by a W2 trip, and he's frustrated that his email campaigns are getting zero responses, leading him to question his CRM's reporting and email deliverability. He is now pivoting his strategy from cold emailing to cold calling. He has already developed a script and call list, and his wife will begin making the calls for him next week.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Start cold calling to generate conversations.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "start" or "get rolling" on cold calling is a clear action, but it lacks a specific number of calls to be made or a target outcome (like conversations or meetings booked).

**Exact Quote:**

"my sort of accountability piece is going to be the, the cold outreach, the cold calling and sort of getting that off, off rolling and seeing if we can generate at least a little bit of conversation off of that."

**Timestamp:**

(34m 25s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Have my wife complete 50 cold calls from the list" OR "Generate 3 qualified conversations from the new cold calling effort."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Paul Awesome job getting that cold calling script and list prepared—and big props for roping in your wife for support! That's brilliant resourcefulness.
>
> I noticed your goal for next week wasn't quite **quantifiable**. I get it, you're just launching this new approach and it's tough to predict outcomes.
>
> Here are a few options to give you a clear target to aim for:
>
> • 📞 Execute the first batch of 50 cold calls
>
> • 💬 Aim to have at least 5 meaningful conversations
>
> • 🎯 Secure 1 qualified discovery call
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Blake Lindsay

**What They Discussed:**

Blake plans to continue posting on LinkedIn but is focused on finding leads within his specific niche. He intends to use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to conduct deep research to identify where to focus his outreach efforts. He also noted that a recent post with a picture received 4-5 times more engagement and plans to analyze why it was so successful.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Use AI to research his niche to figure out where to focus his time.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

"Do some deep research" is an activity, but it lacks a specific deliverable or measurable outcome that defines when the task is complete.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm going to get probably ChatGPT and Gemini to do some deep research for me so that I can figure out where I want to focus my time."

**Timestamp:**

(27m 23s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Use AI to identify 10 online communities or forums where my niche audience gathers" OR "Analyze my 3 most recent posts and create one new content template based on the high-performing one."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Blake That was a super sharp insight about your picture-based post getting 5x the engagement! Leaning into what works is a huge win.
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for your research next week. It's easy for research to become a rabbit hole, so a clear target might help.
>
> How about one of these to make it more concrete?
>
> • 🤖 Use AI to generate a list of 10 keywords your niche uses to find solutions
>
> • 🗺️ Identify 5 key watering holes (forums, subreddits, groups) where your ideal clients hang out
>
> • 📝 Create a new content template based on your high-performing post
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Josh Welch

**What They Discussed:**

Josh expressed that he is also struggling with lead generation for his niche and is tired of LinkedIn. He shared that he feels overwhelmed and short on time due to his W2 job, a school program, and his role organizing a large military hockey tournament. These commitments are making it difficult for him to gain momentum with his own business.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Josh shared his current challenges and workload but did not state any intended actions or commitments for his business for the upcoming week.

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

Here is the expert goal extraction analysis of the mastermind transcript.

---

### Rohit Sinha

**What They Discussed:**

Rohit provided an update on his outreach strategy, explaining how he used AI to segment a list of 522 local food industry businesses into 7-8 categories based on their technical challenges. He found that 75% face issues with scaling. He discussed the low ROI from his previous, more personalized campaigns and explained his plan to shift to a less individualized, more category-specific approach to test its effectiveness. He also mentioned he is continuing with network activation, including rescheduling a meeting with a former classmate.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Reach out to a few people as part of his network activation.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a time reference ("this week"), but the quantity ("a few other people") is vague and not a specific, measurable number.

**Exact Quote:**

"There are a few other people I'm planning on reaching out this week and that's Pretty much on the network activation part."

**Timestamp:**

(30:28)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Reach out to 3 new contacts from my network this week" or "Follow up with my Kellogg batchmate and schedule 2 other networking calls."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Rohit That was an incredible breakdown of how you used AI to segment your list—super smart way to identify that scaling is the core issue for 75% of your targets 👏.
>
> I noticed your goal for network activation wasn't fully quantifiable. Totally understandable, especially when you're also deep in planning a new outreach campaign.
>
> To keep the networking momentum going, here are a few options you could lock in:
>
> • 🤝 Reach out to 3 people from your network
>
> • 🗓️ Schedule 1 call with a networking contact
>
> • ✉️ Send a follow-up to your Kellogg batchmate to get a meeting on the calendar

### Bryan Stephens

**What They Discussed:**

Bryan shared that he is currently focused on serving his two fractional clients and is struggling to balance that work with the need for ongoing networking and outreach. He is going on-site with a new client and wants to make a strong impression in the first 30 days. He also expressed his view that the coaching program is strong on mindset but lacks practical templates and frameworks for the "serve" module, which has led him to seek advice from other successful members.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made.

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Bryan discussed his current challenges, his focus on client work, and his thoughts on the coaching program, but did not set a specific business development or outreach goal for the upcoming week. He mentioned he will be traveling and likely won't be on the next call.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

> While you're traveling, maybe a small, lightweight goal could keep the pipeline warm? Here are a few ideas:

> • 🗓️ Block out one 60-minute "attract" session in your calendar for the week you return
>
> • 🤝 Identify 5 strategic contacts to connect with on LinkedIn
>
> • 📝 Draft one piece of content based on your experience with the new client
>
> No pressure at all, but do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for our next check-in?

### David Shake

**What They Discussed:**

David is in a similar situation to Bryan, balancing work for two active clients with the need to do outreach. He shared his disciplined system of blocking 90 minutes every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning specifically for this task. He also recounted a negative experience with a hired outreach agency that damaged his reputation, reinforcing his belief in doing personalized, manual outreach to find clients he genuinely wants to work with. He feels the program gave him the tools to build his own successful framework, which has been getting amazing reactions recently.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made.

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

David described his existing, ongoing process for outreach but did not state a new, specific goal or outcome he aims to achieve in the upcoming week.

### Andy Levy

**What They Discussed:**

Andy described the coaching program as a "block of Swiss cheese" with holes that members must fill themselves. He is focused on developing an "intel-based market outreach" strategy to more efficiently find the 1% of prospects who are likely to respond, rather than just playing a numbers game. He shared his own frustrating experience with an ineffective outreach agency and mentioned he is cautiously trying another one. He also stressed the importance of niche-specific messaging, which he feels is an area where the program is lacking.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made.

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Andy discussed his strategic thinking, challenges, and high-level approach to outreach, but he did not commit to a specific, actionable task for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

(N/A)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> I noticed you didn’t set a quantifiable goal during the call. It sounds like you're in a deep strategic phase, which is totally understandable after a bad agency experience.
>
> To help turn that strategy into action, here are a few small, concrete goal options:
>
> • 📝 Define 3 key characteristics of your ideal "1%" client profile
>
> • 🧪 Draft one new messaging angle to test with 5 prospects
>
> • 📞 Have 1 call with your new agency partner to align on messaging

Here is the expert analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

### Bob Stewart

**What They Discussed:**

Bob shared that his family has temporarily moved in with him due to a mold issue in their home, forcing him to relocate his office to his unfinished basement. He is treating this as an opportunity to finally build out a proper studio space and is actively in the process of moving and setting everything up. He also discussed his business focus on building a CTO agency framework, creating cold traffic funnels for his courses, and forming advisory boards with other CTOs to serve larger clients.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Rejiggering everything in his new basement office.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "rejiggering everything" is an expression of focus but lacks a specific, measurable outcome or quantity. It's a general statement about an ongoing project without a clear endpoint for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"So it kind of sums up what I'm going to be doing this week... Rejiggering everything."

**Timestamp:**

(20:51)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Set up my desk, computer, and primary recording equipment in the basement" OR "Unpack and organize 5 boxes of office equipment and supplies."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Bob Love that you're turning the basement move into a positive step toward a real studio 👏—that's the perfect mindset.

### Felix Jimenez

**What They Discussed:**

Felix is feeling over-leveraged by his new full-time role as a Field CTO, which he took to ensure financial stability. The company is using his time and expertise extensively, preventing him from building his own fractional CTO business, restarting his podcast, or creating content. He is trying to figure out how to have a difficult conversation with his employer to redefine his role and avoid conflicts of interest while pursuing his own clients.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

To have the difficult conversation with his employer.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While this is a significant and important action, "have the conversation" is a binary task (yes/no). It lacks a measurable count or quantity that can be tracked, making it a vague goal rather than a quantifiable one.

**Exact Quote:**

"Okay, so that'll be the plan for today, to have the difficult conversation, and then next week I'll come back and I'll let you know where we are on... on... you know how that evolved."

### Christian Wiles

**What They Discussed:**

Christian is facing a major strategic dilemma with a long-term client who wants to migrate from a highly-tuned CRM system (Infusionsoft/Keep) to Klaviyo to save money. Christian believes this is a costly mistake that will undermine years of his work and won't be as effective. He is weighing several options: get on board with the plan, try to dissuade the CEO, walk away, or reposition himself as a fractional CTO to manage the transition and create an exit strategy.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made.

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

Christian clearly outlined his challenge and the options he is considering but did not commit to a course of action. He is still in the process of deciding how to proceed with this critical client situation.

**Exact Quote:**

"So number choice number one is get on board. Right... Number two is fully try to dissuade this, this thing from happening. Or option number three is just say, you know what, go ahead and do it, I'm out, I'm out."

**Timestamp:**

(41:50)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Decide on my approach (Option 1, 2, 3, or 4) by Friday" OR "Draft a proposal for the 'Option 4' fractional CTO transition role" OR "List the pros and cons for each of the four potential paths."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Christian It's clear how much value and expertise you've built into that client's system over the years. That's a tough spot to be in when they want to change direction.
>
> I noticed you didn’t land on a **quantifiable goal** during our call. Totally understandable—that's a massive decision you're weighing with a lot of history behind it.
>
> To help move forward, maybe you could commit to one of these:
>
> • 🤔 Make a final decision on your approach (Option 1, 2, 3, or 4)
>
> • 📝 Draft the pros and cons for each of the 4 options to clarify your thinking
>
> • 📄 Outline the key terms for Bob’s "Option 4" proposal (your rate, minimum term, etc.)

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

A lot of work around the software company space

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment is a general statement of focus ("a lot of work") without a specific, measurable action or deliverable for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"A lot of. A lot of work going on this week just around that whole space."

**Timestamp:**

(25:14)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Identify 20 software company CEOs on LinkedIn to target" OR "Draft 2 versions of a cold outreach message for software company founders."

### Filip Szalewicz

**What They Discussed:**

Filip shared his success with highly contextualized cold outreach, noting very high click-through rates, especially in narrow niches. He explained that his clients are pulling him into managing their campaigns, which wasn't his original business plan. He also expressed frustration, stating that he has abandoned his CTOX checklist and found local conferences to be useless for generating business.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Filip provided a detailed status update on his projects and frustrations but did not state a specific action or goal he intended to accomplish in the coming week.

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Filip Those are some phenomenal click-through rates (39%+) on your outreach campaigns—clearly, your contextual approach is working!

### Anthony Jones

**What They Discussed:**

Anthony shared that he's been dealing with significant personal challenges, including his wife being away and his mother's health issues. Professionally, he has made major progress on his Welltrack SaaS application, wiring in automated emails and fixing bugs. He is now planning his go-to-market strategy, which involves giving the tool away for free to add value and showcase his agency's capabilities.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Post a LinkedIn article about the Welltrack app

**Classification:**

✅ Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal has a specific quantity (one article) and a clear time reference ("next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"So I've got a, I've got a, a LinkedIn article that I'm going to be posting next week..."

**Timestamp:**

(32:38)

### Joel Key

**What They Discussed:**

Joel has been working through the CTOX training materials, setting up his one-pager, and creating a spreadsheet to track his outreach metrics for accountability. He feels his in-person efforts are struggling to gain traction and is now experimenting with a workshop intro and developing a technical assessment offering. He plans to offer two of these assessments for free to see if it generates interest.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Continuing through the network activation

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

"Continuing" is an ongoing activity, not a specific, measurable goal with a defined outcome for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"Next week I guess the big goals is continuing through the network activation."

**Timestamp:**

(37:54)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send the workshop intro email to 5 prospects" OR "Finalize the question list for the technical assessment."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Joel Awesome job setting up a spreadsheet to track your outreach metrics! That kind of accountability is a game-changer.
> 
> I noticed your goal to "continue network activation" wasn't quantifiable. It's easy for goals to be general when you're experimenting with new approaches like the workshop and technical assessment.
> 
> To make it more concrete, how about one of these?
> 
> • 📧 Send your workshop intro email to 5 stalled prospects
> 
> • ✅ Finalize the first draft of questions for your technical assessment
> 
> • 📢 Create the draft for the LinkedIn post offering 2 free assessments
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### John Fitzpatrick

**What They Discussed:**

After returning from vacation, John's main focus has been consolidating his knowledge management system into Obsidian, setting it up to sync across all his devices. He is frustrated by stagnant client projects and the time spent sorting information. He also shared that his internet issues are finally resolved, unblocking him from finishing a LinkedIn tool he has been building.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Get his LinkedIn tool done

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While the commitment is to complete a project ("get my... tool... done"), it lacks a specific deadline within the upcoming week, making it too broad.

**Exact Quote:**

"So and so my goal is to get my. My LinkedIn tool I was working on done."

**Timestamp:**

(47:06)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the final 2 features for the LinkedIn tool" OR "Deploy the LinkedIn tool to a testing environment by Friday."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @John It’s great to hear your internet is finally fixed—that must be a huge relief and will unblock so much for you!
> 
> I noticed your goal to "get your LinkedIn tool done" wasn’t quite quantifiable for a one-week sprint. It sounds like a big project, and breaking it down can help.
> 
> Here are a few options for a next step:
> 
> • ✅ Complete the final 2 core features of the tool
> 
> • 🚀 Deploy the first version of the tool to a testing environment

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Michael provided a positive update on his pipeline but did not commit to any specific actions for the upcoming week. His focus is on nurturing the opportunities he currently has.

### Amanda Kabak

**What They Discussed:**

Amanda has started cold outreach on LinkedIn and is seeing an 11% positive response rate to her connection requests. However, she is struggling to turn those new connections into actual conversations. Paul McRae suggested creating a workshop to introduce herself, which Amanda acknowledged is something she needs to think more about.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Spend time thinking about a workshop idea.

**Classification:**

Decision Pending

**Why This Classification:**

This is not a commitment to a specific action. "Spend some time thinking" is a cognitive process without a clear, verifiable outcome, and she hasn't decided *if* she will create a workshop, only that she needs to consider it.

**Exact Quote:**

"Yeah, I haven't. I haven't figured one out yet. I guess I need to spend some time thinking about that."

**Timestamp:**

(19m 23s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Brainstorm and list 3 potential workshop topics" OR "Research 5 competitor workshops to identify a potential angle."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Amanda An 11% positive response rate on LinkedIn is a fantastic start—that shows your targeting is on the right track!
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for the week around the workshop idea. It’s totally normal to need some thinking time before diving into something new like that.
>
> To help you build momentum, here are a few options you could lock in:
>
> • 💡 Brainstorm 3 potential workshop topics
>
> • 🗺️ Outline the key talking points for 1 workshop idea

> • 🕵️ Research 5 competitor workshops to see what’s working

### Paul McRae

**What They Discussed:**

Paul is dealing with the chaos of a growing business and is focused on delegation. He's struggling to find affordable marketing help after receiving a quote for $15,000/month. He has two new contracts about to be signed and has strategically decided to delegate his senior living business due to its long sales cycles and lower revenue, planning to find someone to take it over after a new deal kicks off on November 1st.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Find someone to help with his senior living business.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "try and find somebody" is a vague intention rather than a specific, measurable action. The timeline is also not for this coming week, but rather sometime after November 1st.

**Exact Quote:**

"So somewhere in there, I'm going to have to try and find somebody who can help me out, because I want to start disconnecting from that business."

**Timestamp:**

(22:18)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Draft a 1-page role description for the senior living business delegate" OR "Identify and reach out to 2 potential candidates to discuss the opportunity."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Paul Huge congrats on getting two new contracts agreed to—that's amazing momentum!
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for this coming week. It sounds like you're making some great strategic decisions on delegation, and it's smart to plan ahead for that senior living business handoff.
>
> To keep things moving, here are a few clear actions you could take this week:
>
> • 📝 Draft the role description for the person taking over the senior living business
>
> • 🤝 Identify and reach out to 2 potential marketing partners to explore options
>
> • 📅 Schedule that chat with Don to discuss finding someone from the CMO X group
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Paul Benson

**What They Discussed:**

Paul is actively delegating by bringing on a new marketing person, a junior tech person for day-to-day tasks, and a project manager. His website redesign is nearly complete, and a drip campaign is ready to launch. He shared a recent success where he positioned himself as a fractional CTO who oversees work rather than doing it all, which has led to a promising second conversation with a new lead.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

To have a conversation with Paul McRae.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment has a specific action (have a conversation, which is a count of 1) and a clear time reference ("this week"). This is a binary, verifiable outcome.

**Exact Quote:**

"we'll get it in this week."

**Timestamp:**

(27m 50s)

### Benjamin Sanders

**What They Discussed:**

Benjamin had to leave the call early for a client meeting, noting he is busy managing the chaos of a full client load. He shared that two new, interesting project-based opportunities have emerged. One is a massive, unexpected project to help his brother-in-law use AI to improve yields at a large shrimp factory in Venezuela, which he estimates could be a half-million-dollar MVP.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Benjamin provided a status update on new business opportunities but had to leave the call before he could set a commitment for the upcoming week.

**Exact Quote:**

### Ben Benone

**What They Discussed:**

This was Ben's first call. He is transitioning out of a 20-year career at one company where he worked extremely long hours. His primary concerns are managing cash flow and building a new sales pipeline. His network is currently limited to his deep niche in SaaS for life sciences (R&D labs), and he has already started networking by attending a local CTO breakfast to expand his connections.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

As a new participant, Ben introduced himself, shared his background, and outlined his current situation. He did not set a forward-looking goal for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

N/A

**Timestamp:**

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send 10 new connection requests on LinkedIn to leaders in the life sciences space" OR "Schedule 1 virtual coffee with someone from your existing network to discuss your transition."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Ben Welcome to the group! It was great to meet you, and it's awesome that you're already getting out there and networking at events like the CTO breakfast.

### Bryan Stephens

**What They Discussed:**

Bryan shared that he is struggling to balance serving his new fractional client with the need to find more clients. He landed his second client through a personal referral, not the program's platform, and is now deep in the onboarding process. He expressed frustration that the program's content feels "hand wavy" and lacks concrete templates or roadmaps for client delivery, which is what he needs right now.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Meet with the IT and development directors at his new client to facilitate communication between them.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment has a specific action (meet with two key directors) and a clear time reference ("for the next two weeks"). It's a verifiable task with a defined scope.

**Exact Quote:**

"So for the next two weeks, I'm going to meet with it develop so there's an IT director and there's a development director, and I'm going to be kind of presiding over both of those and making them talk to each other."

**Timestamp:**

(7:42)

### Nirav Sheth

**What They Discussed:**

Nirav agreed with Bryan that the main value of the program is the network, not the content itself. He recently finished a due diligence (DD) project that he secured through LinkedIn, but felt he only got the work because the client wanted a favorable report. He has a crucial meeting next week with an investor who has a portfolio of 100 companies, which could be a major breakthrough for his business.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

He provided a detailed status update on a recently completed project and mentioned an important upcoming meeting, but did not commit to a specific action or outcome for the week ahead.

### David Brumbaugh

**What They Discussed:**

David shared that he feels his business is diverging from the standard fractional CTO path taught in the program, which makes it difficult for him to set a relevant goal. He emphasized that he loves the peer group and the community and doesn't want to lose that connection, but feels "so far off course" from the curriculum.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

He explicitly stated that he did not have a quantifiable goal because his current work doesn't align with the program's focus.

**Exact Quote:**

"Absolutely. Now, what I don't have is a quantifiable goal on this, because it's so far outside the CTO."

**Timestamp:**

(24:23)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Identify 1 key takeaway from the program that can be adapted to my current business" or "Reach out to 2 peers in the community to discuss my business pivot and get their perspective."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @David It's awesome that you're getting traction, even if it's taking you on a different path—that's a great problem to have!
> 
> 
> As you mentioned on the call, you didn't set a **quantifiable goal**. I completely get why—it can be tough when your focus shifts away from the core curriculum.
>

> 
> • 🤝 Connect with 2 other members who might be on a similar, non-traditional path

### Andy Levy

**What They Discussed:**

Andy expressed his current challenge with lead generation and email outreach, which are new skills for him. He has outsourced some of this work but is struggling to vet third-party marketing agencies effectively. He finds immense value in the small breakout sessions for sharing "gold nuggets" of advice that are often lost in the larger, hard-to-search Slack channels.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

He described his current challenges with marketing and information overload but did not commit to a specific action to address them in the upcoming week.

Here is the goal extraction analysis from the mastermind call transcript.

### George Reyna

**What They Discussed:**

George reflected on the importance of having a repeatable framework and how referrals are currently driving his business. He later shared his own struggles with mindset, noting how he was "obsessed with not knowing what to do" and how that held him back. He is now focused on continuing to feed his pipeline even while busy, as he is starting to feel his capacity thinning, which is prompting him to explore hiring more employees to scale his fractional CTO services.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Talk with Chris from CTO X about their hiring process.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This is a specific action but lacks a quantifiable element (like a number of questions to prepare) or a clear deadline (e.g., "schedule the call by Friday"). It expresses intent but isn't a measurable goal for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"So, yeah, I'm actually going to be talking with Chris from CTO X, and we're going to just kind of talk about, like, what the, you know, hiring process for, you know, their their bucket looks like, and whatnot."

**Timestamp:**

(34:57)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Schedule the call with Chris from CTO X" OR "Draft 3 key questions to ask Chris about his hiring process."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @George Great to hear you're proactively thinking about scaling before you hit a hard capacity limit 👏—that's a smart move.
>
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during our call. Totally get it; it sounds like you're in the early stages of figuring out that hiring process.
>
> Here are a few options you could lock in to keep the momentum going:
>
> • 🗓️ Schedule the call with Chris from CTO X
>
> • 📝 Draft 3 key questions to ask Chris about his process
>
> • 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Identify the #1 task you would delegate to a new hire
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Paul McRae

**What They Discussed:**

Paul shared that he's feeling off balance after a promising client unexpectedly tried to renegotiate a lower rate, which he sees as a major red flag. He is weighing whether to walk away, especially since two other projects (Jaro Go and a quantum computing venture) have significant momentum. He discussed his need to be better at trusting his gut, holding his boundaries, and not wasting time on clients who show they aren't a good fit from the start.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Send a response email to the client who tried to lower the rate.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "send it out" is a clear action but lacks a specific deadline within the statement, making it vague on timing.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'll, I'll keep trimming, and I'll send it out."

**Timestamp:**

(28:59)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Finalize and send the response email by end of day Tuesday" OR "Spend 1 hour scrubbing contacts from the Leads Genius list."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Paul Awesome to hear the quantum computing and Jaro Go projects are gaining such strong traction! Congrats on those wins.
>
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. It's completely understandable—that client situation sounds frustrating and requires careful thought before you respond.
>
> Here are a few options you could lock in to move forward:
>
> • 📧 Send the finalized response email to that client
>
> •  scrubbing 100 contacts from your existing lead list
>
> • 📞 Schedule 1 follow-up call with a partner prospect (like Tata)
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Amanda Kabak

**What They Discussed:**

Amanda provided a brief update, stating that while nothing has landed yet, she is having good conversations and things are moving "slow but sure." Her key update was that she had just started a new activity: doing cold outreach and sending connection requests on LinkedIn to people she doesn't know, opening up a new channel for leads.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Amanda's update was a report on a new activity she just started ("just today started some cold outreach"). She did not commit to a specific action or outcome for the upcoming week.

### Paul Benson

**What They Discussed:**

Paul is making tangible progress in stepping away from his day job by hiring two new people—one to help with general tasks and a project manager. He plans to attend the Next Gen conference in November to "work the room" and is also preparing to launch a cold marketing campaign to the FQHCs in his pipeline.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Start to do cold marketing to FQHCs.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The phrase "getting ready to start to do some marketing" is an intention, not a specific, measurable action. It lacks a number (e.g., emails to send) and a clear deadline for completion.

**Exact Quote:**

"...we're getting ready to start to do some marketing. Cold, cold marketing to them."

**Timestamp:**

(23:43)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Draft the first cold marketing email for the FQHC campaign" OR "Finalize the target list of the first 25 FQHCs to contact."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Paul It's fantastic that you've hired two people to start taking things off your plate! That's a huge step toward focusing on what matters most.
>
>
> I heard you mention you’re getting ready to start cold marketing, but we didn't lock in a specific, **quantifiable goal** for it. Totally get it, especially with juggling the day job, new hires, and conference prep.
>
> To get the ball rolling, here are a few potential goals:
>
> • ✍️ Draft the first cold email for your FQHC outreach
>
> • 🎯 Finalize a list of 20 FQHCs to target first
>
> • 🤝 Delegate 1 specific task to one of your new hires
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

Here is the analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

---

### David Brumbaugh

**What They Discussed:**

David explained that he feels off-course from the program's main focus because he's simultaneously building a new payment platform startup while still pursuing some fractional CTO work. His new venture aims to replace Stripe, specifically targeting conservative Christian nonprofits and potentially gun-related businesses, which he says Stripe is hostile towards. He detailed the business model, which involves partnering with industry experts to own and pre-define the risk for this specific niche, making it a compelling alternative.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Have two meetings with potential fractional CTO clients this week.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal includes a specific count (2 meetings) and a clear time reference ("this week").

**Exact Quote:**

"Let me do. Let me do two meetings with potential clients this week. I can do that."

**Timestamp:**

(25:29)

---

### Konst Mroncz

**What They Discussed:**

Konst shared his growing disillusionment with LinkedIn outreach, despite some recent positive responses after five weeks of effort. He found a new, effective tactic: turning inbound sales pitches into partnership opportunities. He feels he needs to shift his focus toward using Jordan's AI prospecting email strategies and making better use of his CRM, which he currently finds difficult to populate. He's undecided about renewing the contract for his LinkedIn outreach assistant in two weeks and is looking for a more effective lead-generation method.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Spend more time with Jordan's AI prospecting emails and get the CRM going.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

"Spend more time" is a vague intention that lacks a specific, measurable outcome or quantity.

**Exact Quote:**

"I need to spend a lot more time with Jordan's prospecting emails and spend a lot more time inside the CRM getting that going."

**Timestamp:**

(37:44)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Draft 3 AI prospecting email templates using Jordan's method" or "Add 25 new prospects to the CRM and send the first email sequence."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Konst That strategy of flipping inbound sales calls into partnerships is brilliant—super resourceful! 👏
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for the week. Totally understandable, especially when you're re-evaluating what’s working and exploring new methods like the AI prospecting.
> 
> Here are a few options to lock in some momentum on that front:
> 
> • 🤖 Draft 3 AI prospecting email templates based on Jordan's videos.
> 
> • 📇 Add 25 new prospects into your CRM to start building that pipeline.
> 
> • ✉️ Send 10 personalized, AI-assisted emails to test the new method.
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Andrew Grady

**What They Discussed:**

Andrew reported a very productive week, significantly expanding his network in the senior living industry through his father's connections. He has finalized his market research using Claude to create a knowledge base, which he's now using to fine-tune his outreach. While his cold emails are getting opened, they aren't generating responses, so his next step is to A/B test different email templates to improve conversions and book more calls.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Book three more calls.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a specific number (3) and has an implied deadline of this week (before the next call).

**Exact Quote:**

"And then I also want my goal is to book three more calls."

**Timestamp:**

(47:04)

---

### Alex Rodriguez

**What They Discussed:**

Alex is one month into the program and has found great success with network activation, reconnecting with contacts who are very supportive. He is building a "gold list" of 50 people, has secured a domain name, and is focused on getting his website ready for a crucial meeting with a CTO contact on the 24th. He also shared his pleasant surprise with LinkedIn engagement, getting over 1,000 impressions per post, and plans to shift from partnership-focused content to thought leadership.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Get his website ready for his meeting on the 24th and continue working his list of 50 contacts.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal has a deadline ("the 24th"), but the deliverable ("get that ready") is not specific or measurable. Continuing to work a list is a process, not a quantifiable outcome for the week.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm giving myself to the 24th to get that ready because I have a big, big meeting with another contact..."

**Timestamp:**

(49:28)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the first draft of the website homepage and services page copy" or "Reach out to 10 more contacts from my list of 50."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Alex Awesome job with the network activation and fantastic to see that traction on your LinkedIn posts! Getting 1k+ impressions right away is a huge win. 🙌
> 
> 
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** for next week. It makes sense that you're focused on the bigger picture with that important meeting on the 24th.
> 
> To keep the momentum, here are a few concrete options you could lock in for this week:
> 
> • ✍️ Complete the first draft of your website homepage copy.
> 
> • 📞 Reach out to 10 more people from your list of 50.
> 
> • 💡 Outline 2 thought leadership posts for LinkedIn.
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Rhett Ward

**What They Discussed:**

Rhett reintroduced himself to the group, explaining he is re-engaging with the program after a long break due to travel and a demanding W2 job. His main challenge is time management and overcoming a mental block regarding his online presence, as he plans to operate in the same industry as his current employer. He had a breakthrough realizing he can target different clients to avoid a conflict of interest and is now ready to move forward with foundational steps like creating his one-pager and getting organized.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Fill out his weekly momentum sheet, create at least one one-pager, and book a follow-up call with Donna.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This commitment consists of three distinct, verifiable tasks to be completed within a clear timeframe ("between now and next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"...between now and next week, I'm going to be filling out the sheet, doing at least a single one pager, and then booking a follow up with Donna..."

Session Date: 2025-10-10

Here is the goal extraction analysis from the transcript.

### Andy Levy

**What They Discussed:**

Andy expressed his primary challenge is the lack of a clear, well-defined path for acquiring clients, describing the process as "foggy." He feels uncertain about what specific actions to take to move his business forward, especially with tasks he's new to, like lead generation and email outreach. He also voiced frustration with the program's disorganization, citing the large number of platforms and the poor search functionality in Slack, which makes it difficult to find valuable information shared by the group.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Andy discussed his challenges, frustrations, and the state of his business but did not commit to any future actions or tasks for the upcoming week.

### Michael Faas

**What They Discussed:**

Michael primarily acted as a supportive voice, agreeing with Andy's challenges. He affirmed that piecing together all the program's content is difficult and validated the frustration with Slack, noting it's a great communication tool but a poor content management system. He also reinforced that most members, including himself, come from technical leadership backgrounds and are new to sales and marketing.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Michael participated in the conversation by agreeing with others and providing perspective but did not set a goal for himself before he had to leave the meeting.

### Pankil Patel

**What They Discussed:**

Pankil was in agreement with Andy's sentiments, stating he is in the "same boat." He highlighted that, like others, he comes from a technical background and has no prior experience in sales and marketing, making this a new and challenging area for him. He also briefly concurred with the group's frustrations regarding Slack's search functionality.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

Session Date: 2025-10-10
================================================================================

Here is the goal extraction analysis from the mastermind call transcript.

---

### William May

**What They Discussed:**

William provided an update on his LinkedIn content, stating he's posting once a week to stay top-of-mind with his network. He's facing technical challenges getting his website live on CRMx and may switch back to GoDaddy. His primary focus remains on his "golden network," which is successfully putting him in front of relevant people, and he is waiting to hear back from a company he spoke with last week.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Have a conversation with 5 to 10 new people from his network.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a specific number (5 to 10 people) and a clear time reference ("the upcoming week"). The action is to "have a conversation," which is a distinct outcome beyond a simple outreach.

**Exact Quote:**

"So my commitment is going to be to at least hit another five to 10 people for my you know, when I say hit them, not just email, get to talk to them, have a conversation with them, whether it's via email or on the phone, directly, but to have a conversation, not just to reach out. So that's going to be on me to make that happen, and that'll be my commit for the upcoming week"

**Timestamp:**

(10:11)

---

### Shant Mardigian

**What They Discussed:**

Shant expressed some frustration with his own progress, feeling he hasn't put in enough work and keeps going back and forth on his direction. He questioned the effectiveness of cold outreach for someone without an established brand and mentioned he is focusing on reaching out to his existing network to let them know what he's working on.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Talk to three people, finalize his business name, email, and website, and finalize his one-pager.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a specific number (talk to 3 people) and several clear deliverables (finalized name, email, website, one-pager) tied to a deadline ("by next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"by next week, I want to hit up three people where I'm talking, I talked to three people, and I need to finalize a name email, finalized name, email And website. I want to finalize my one pager."

**Timestamp:**

(10:34)

---

### Mark Alcazar

**What They Discussed:**

Mark shared that he felt stuck with manual cold outreach but found new momentum after exploring Apollo, a sales engagement platform. He is excited about its potential for multi-touch campaigns and automation. He also shared a significant win: one of his genuine, story-based LinkedIn posts resonated with someone in his ICP (who was also in his network), leading directly to a promising sales call.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Crack the outreach code with Apollo and launch multi-step campaigns.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal to "crack the outreach code" is an abstract outcome, not a measurable action. While "launch multi-step campaigns" is an action, it lacks a specific number (e.g., how many campaigns or to how many people) to make it verifiable.

**Exact Quote:**

"my goal for the next week is to do crack the outreach code with Apollo... So hopefully from that, I will launch the multi step campaigns"

**Timestamp:**

(29:26)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Launch my first multi-step campaign to 25 prospects in Apollo" OR "Build and launch 2 distinct outreach sequences by the end of the week."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mark Great to hear how playing with Apollo got you feeling unstuck, and congrats on landing a call with your ICP from that LinkedIn post—that's a huge win!
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during the call. Totally understandable, as it sounds like you're in the learning phase with a new tool.
>
> To keep that momentum going, here are a few options you could lock in:
>
> • 🚀 Launch your first multi-step campaign to 25 prospects
>
> • 🏗️ Build out 2 distinct outreach sequences in Apollo
>
> • 🎯 Identify and add 50 new ideal prospects to an Apollo list
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Jon Benedict

**What They Discussed:**

Jon explained his unique situation as a sitting CIO, focusing his efforts on his existing network and forming strategic partnerships rather than cold outreach. He plans to leverage his position to connect with other small hospitals, offering fractional services to address their common budget and staffing challenges. He and William identified potential for collaboration and agreed to connect offline to explore a joint venture.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Revisit his website and one-pager, and connect with Will to discuss a potential partnership.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goals are expressed as intentions rather than specific, measurable outcomes. "Revisit" and "freshen up" are vague, and "connect and talk about maybe" is an exploratory action without a defined deliverable.

**Exact Quote:**

"So for my goals, what I'd like to do this week, I need to, need to revisit my website and freshen it up a little... I need to revisit my one pager... and will I'm going to put down that you and I are going to connect and talk about maybe some type of a joint venture partnership"

**Timestamp:**

(38:21)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Update the 'Problem I Solve' section on my website and one-pager" OR "Schedule the call with Will and outline 3 potential collaboration models."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Jon That's a brilliant strategy to leverage your current CIO role to connect with peers, and the idea of partnering with Will sounds like it has huge potential. Also, saving your hospital over a quarter-million dollars is incredible! 👏
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during our call. It sounds like you're firming up your core messaging and exploring new opportunities, which is awesome.
>
> To help solidify that direction, here are a few goal options:

### Nirav Sheth

**What They Discussed:**

Nirav provided a detailed update on a major investment deal for a new software project, where funding is released in trenches contingent on securing the first client. He also discussed a recent due diligence (DD) project he completed by subcontracting to another member, Kevin, and shared his learnings. He expressed frustration with potential clients focusing on hours worked versus the value delivered, a common challenge in the fractional CTO model.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Nirav discussed many ongoing activities, such as a pending meeting with an investor and a proposal with Bob for a private equity fund, but he did not explicitly state a new action item or goal he would complete before the next call.

### Bryan Stephens

**What They Discussed:**

Bryan celebrated signing his second fractional CTO client, which he acquired organically through his network rather than the platform he's a part of. He's now focused on the onboarding process for this new client and is feeling the need for more tangible resources like templates and roadmaps. He's questioning the value of his current accelerator program and plans to push the coaches for more practical "serve" content.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Pin the coaches in the corner and ask them for some deliverables on the "serve" content.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

While this is a clear action item, it lacks a specific, measurable outcome. "Ask them for some deliverables" is vague and doesn't specify how many coaches he'll contact, what he'll ask for, or what a successful outcome looks like.

**Exact Quote:**

"I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pin the coaches in the corner and ask them for some deliverables on this serve thing, whatever I find, I will share at the group..."

**Timestamp:**

(43m 18s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Schedule 1 call with a coach to request onboarding templates" OR "Draft an email to the coaches outlining the 3 specific types of 'serve' templates I need for my new client."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Bryan Huge congrats on signing your second fractional client—that's awesome momentum!
>
>
> I noticed your goal to connect with the coaches about templates was a bit open-ended. Makes total sense, as you're probably just starting to define what you need from them.
>
> Here are a few options to make that more concrete:
>
> • 📧 Draft an email to the coaches outlining the 3 specific types of templates you need for onboarding.

> • 🗓️ Schedule 1 call with a coach to specifically request their "serve" content.

### David Taiwo

**What They Discussed:**

David shared a significant win from the past week. After being hesitant, he posted on LinkedIn announcing his new fractional CTO business. He was surprised and encouraged by the amount of positive engagement and outreach he received from his network as a direct result, noting it was more effective than his other content efforts.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

### Bob Stewart

**What They Discussed:**

Bob is refining his outreach strategy to focus on companies with over 100 employees, a "cream skimming" approach to find clients concerned with results, not cost. Inspired by a recent seminar, he's shifting his primary focus to building a mailing list, potentially with a $1 entry fee to qualify leads. He also discussed his long-term vision for his Skool community (CTO.CEO) as a hub for high-caliber fractional CTOs to collaborate on advisory boards.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Finish migrating to Sales Robot, wrap up a campaign, and start creating his mailing list.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment contains multiple parts, but phrases like "wrap up that campaign" and "get on the creation" are vague and lack specific, measurable outcomes. While "finish moving... this week" has a deadline, the overall goal lacks the necessary clarity to be considered quantifiable.

**Exact Quote:**

"I will finish moving my stuff to sales robot this week. I will wrap up that campaign, and I will get on the creation of my mailing list."

**Timestamp:**

(14m 16s - 14m 24s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

- "Complete the contact migration to Sales Robot and deactivate the old system."
- "Send the final email of the current campaign and document its open/reply rates."
- "Outline the first 3 emails for the new mailing list sequence."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Bob That story about the $1 mailing list generating $1.5M was incredible—thanks for sharing that insight with the group. It sounds like a powerful strategic shift for you.
>
> I noticed your goals for the week were a little broad. Totally get it when you're juggling a migration, a current campaign, and a brand new initiative.
>
> To help you get traction, here are a few options you could lock in:

> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in?

### Christopher Etienne

**What They Discussed:**

Christopher has tweaked his messaging and content strategy after recommitting to his niche. He has established a consistent LinkedIn routine of posting 2-3 times per week and commenting 10-15 times, but is deprioritizing his website for now. He will be at a Salesforce conference and will miss next week's meeting, so his focus this week is on preparing content to stay active while he's away. He also mentioned his hesitation to start his YouTube channel despite having all the equipment ready.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Prepare LinkedIn content to be scheduled for next week while he is away.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "work on some additional LinkedIn content" is vague. It doesn't specify a quantity of posts to be created or a clear definition of "done."

**Exact Quote:**

"So for the rest of the week, I'm simply going to work on some additional LinkedIn content. So I have that scheduled for next week."

**Timestamp:**

(17m 10s - 17m 17s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

- "Write and schedule 3 LinkedIn posts to publish while at the conference."
- "Draft 10 strategic comments to post on key accounts' content next week."
- "Record the raw footage for his first YouTube video."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Christopher It's awesome that you've built a solid routine of 2-3 LinkedIn posts per week—that consistency is a huge win!
>
> I noticed your goal before the conference was to "work on" some content. Makes total sense to prep before you travel.
>
> To make that super clear, here are a few options:
>
> • ✍️ Write and schedule 3 LinkedIn posts to go out while you’re away.
> • 💬 Draft 10 high-value comments to engage with key people in your niche.
> • 🎬 Record the raw footage for your very first YouTube video (no editing needed yet!).
>
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in? Enjoy the conference!

### Michael Kofman

**What They Discussed:**

Michael is running an AI workshop this Friday and has been focusing heavily on a product he's developing to automate large-scale code modernization. This product has helped him clarify his niche and messaging. He is preparing a new demo of the product for a key stakeholder this week, aiming for a better reaction than "that's cute." He acknowledged a need to improve his content creation and was motivated by Bob's mailing list idea.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Michael provided a detailed update on his current projects (the workshop and product demo), both happening this week, but he did not set a specific goal or commitment for the following week.

**Exact Quote:**

He is also exploring a partnership with a security firm (SQ One) to add penetration testing and remediation to his service offerings.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

### Tim Faith

**What They Discussed:**

As a new member in his first week, Tim is focused on getting off the ground. He shared his extensive 30-year background in enterprise applications and ERP systems, including his time at Gartner leading the ERP Magic Quadrant research. He is working on narrowing down his niche, likely focusing on healthcare staffing and consulting, and plans to connect with his mentor to review his findings.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Review and finalize his niche, and make two LinkedIn posts.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "post out two LinkedIn post" includes a specific number (2) and a clear time reference ("next week"), making it quantifiable. The goal to "nail down" his niche is also part of his plan, though it's the posting goal that is measurable.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

Daniel provided an update on his recent conference attendance and a promising partnership conversation. He mentioned being "stuck" on a previous task but did not commit to a new action for the upcoming week.

Excellent. Here is the goal extraction analysis from the transcript.

---

### Ryan Sheehan

**What They Discussed:**

Ryan introduced himself as a new member and shared that he is currently balancing a full-time W2 job while trying to transition into fractional work. He is about two-thirds of the way through his CTO-X onboarding checklist. He shared a recent success story where a client he was previously helping for potential equity converted to a paid retainer deal, which he felt validated the group's advice against working for free.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Finish the pre-game flight plan checklist.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal has a clear deliverable (completing the checklist, which is a measurable outcome of 100%) and a specific time reference ("this week").

**Exact Quote:**

"So I'll be wrapping that up this week, and then I'm assuming there's more calls to schedule, is what I'm assuming."

**Timestamp:**

(17m 47s)

### Jeff Carson

**What They Discussed:**

Jeff is also new to the group and is in a similar onboarding stage as Ryan, about two-thirds of the way through the materials. His official onboarding call is scheduled for this Friday. He recently left his W2 CTO role about two months ago to start his fractional business and has already secured his first contract.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Jeff provided a status update on his onboarding progress and mentioned his upcoming call, but he did not commit to a specific action he would take in the coming week.

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the final third of the onboarding materials before my Friday call" OR "Identify 3 key questions about niching to ask during my onboarding call."

### Murali Kotla

**What They Discussed:**

Murali rejoined the group after being away for a couple of months, explaining that he's been dealing with significant life events. He called in from a noisy metro and couldn't share details but committed to updating the group properly during the next meeting.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Share an update on his situation at the next meeting.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This is a commitment to communicate rather than a business-related action. While it has a time reference ("next week"), it lacks a measurable business outcome.

**Exact Quote:**

"but I will share in our next week. On Wednesday meeting..."

**Timestamp:**

(21:35)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Review my sales pipeline and identify 1 lead to re-engage" OR "Spend 1 hour reviewing my business goals for the remainder of the year."

> @Murali Welcome back, it's great to see you! It sounds like you've been through a lot, and we're looking forward to catching up with you properly next week.

> • 📂 Review your sales pipeline for 30 minutes to get reacquainted

### Mehmet Turkuzan

**What They Discussed:**

Mehmet updated the group on a promising lead who intends to bring him on in an advisory role, potentially transitioning to a fractional CTO position later. While the conversation was positive, no contract has been signed yet, so he is following up periodically. He has another low-probability lead who wants an equity-only deal, which he is not pursuing actively. His current focus is on writing LinkedIn posts and watching Sales Gym videos.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Mehmet described his ongoing activities (sending reminders, writing posts) and a scheduled call, but he did not set a new, specific goal for the upcoming week.

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Write and schedule 2 LinkedIn posts for this week" OR "Complete 3 modules of the Sales Gym and document key takeaways" OR "Send 1 follow-up email to the advisory role prospect with a value-add article."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mehmet That's fantastic news about the advisory role moving forward—sounds like a very promising opportunity!
> 
> On the call, you mentioned your current focus is on LinkedIn and Sales Gym, but you didn't lock in a **quantifiable goal**. I know it's tough when you're in a "waiting game" with a lead.
>

> 
> • ✍️ Write and schedule 2 LinkedIn posts
> 
> • 🏋️ Complete 3 modules of the Sales Gym
>

### Ajay Chankramath

**What They Discussed:**

Ajay shared several significant wins. Two recent contracts are progressing well, with content approved for one that is set to go live on November 13. A third deal with a publishing company has been verbally approved and is just awaiting paperwork. Most notably, a major fractional CTO opportunity he thought was dead was revived when the prospect reached out to restart conversations.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Ajay provided an excellent update on his progress and momentum, but his report focused on past events and things that are now in motion. He did not state a specific action item he plans to complete next week.

**Exact Quote:**

"N/A"

**Timestamp:**

(N/A)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Draft and send the follow-up email to the revived CTO lead" OR "Outline the 3 key preparation steps for the November 13th launch" OR "Follow up with the publishing company to get an ETA on the paperwork."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Ajay Seriously impressive update! Having content approved, a third deal greenlit, and a major lead come back from the dead is an amazing trifecta of wins 🚀.
>

### Todd Deshane

**What They Discussed:**

Todd reported very good progress, leveraging his connections from the AI MakerSpace community. He had a promising conversation with a contact who is moving into a VP of Engineering role and wants to collaborate on a large-scale AI project. This has also inspired him to reconnect with his father, an engineer, to discuss a potential collaboration. Separately, he landed a small, paid mentorship gig, also through the AI MakerSpace community.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Reach out to his dad to have a conversation to better prepare for the upcoming engineering opportunity.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The goal is a specific action ("reach out to my dad and have the conversation") with a clear count (1 conversation) and a defined timeframe ("the next week").

**Exact Quote:**

"so, I guess my, I guess my action item would be to reach out to my dad and have the conversation, or the next week so that I can better prepare for the engineering opportunity that's coming."

### Anthony Jones

**What They Discussed:**

Anthony provided an update on his progress, noting he's made some website updates using the AIDA framework and GPT for feedback. He is considering a service swap with a LinkedIn messaging coach to improve his outreach. He feels his content is getting better but has pivoted from a HIPAA project due to technical limitations and is now passionately focused on building a new hospice application using a tool called Replit, which he finds incredibly exciting and fun.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Post his weekly update on LinkedIn, continue working on workshops, and get his new app sorted out.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "post my weekly update on LinkedIn" is quantifiable. It has a count (one update) and a clear time reference (weekly), meeting both criteria. The other parts of his commitment ("continue to work on") are not quantifiable, but he did set at least one clear goal.

### Tony Winter

**What They Discussed:**

Tony shared a significant win with a recent LinkedIn post that reached over 5,500 impressions after he analyzed his past content with ChatGPT and focused on making it more human. He noted that his focus on the private equity niche is proving to be a slow-burn, so while keeping those leads warm, he's shifting focus. This has led to a promising fractional CTO opportunity, for which he has already met with the CEO twice.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Have a call with the engineering leadership of a potential client.

**Classification:**

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Here is the analysis of the mastermind call transcript.

---

### Paul Benson

**What They Discussed:**

Paul is currently on-site with a client who recently converted him to a fractional CTO. His primary challenge is being too hands-on, which prevents him from focusing on business development. To solve this, he plans to hire a Level 1 technician to handle day-to-day tasks. His new website and a 200-person email drip campaign are both scheduled to launch by next Tuesday.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Make 5 calls to his network.

### Rohit Sinha

**What They Discussed:**

Rohit reported that his recent email campaign to ~150 contacts yielded no responses, and he has a meeting scheduled with Donna next week to refine his messaging. He has successfully started activating his professional network, holding two meetings last week that provided good feedback. His main blocker is finding the time to format and publish his long-form articles on LinkedIn, which has halted his content creation for the past two weeks.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Focus on activating his network.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment is an intention ("focus on") rather than a specific, measurable action. It lacks a clear number or a verifiable outcome.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Identify his sub-ICPs and create a target list of companies within them.

This goal has a specific, verifiable deliverable (the identified ICPs and the company list are either done or not done) and a clear deadline ("by end of next week").

### Keith Piccininno

**What They Discussed:**

Keith provided an update on a significant proposal he submitted last week. The potential client reviewed it live with him and had positive feedback, only asking for a small clarification to be added to the investment section specifying that the initial phase is for discovery. A follow-up meeting is tentatively scheduled for the first full week of October, but the client said they might try to convene the team sooner.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

Keith provided a detailed status update and is currently in a holding pattern, waiting for the client to schedule the next meeting. He expressed hope for more leads but did not commit to any specific actions for the upcoming week.

### Bryan Stephens

**What They Discussed:**

Bryan shared some advice with the group, particularly for Tim, recommending Jordan Crawford's resources for refining one's niche and outreach messaging. He then asked the group for help with a challenge: he needs to develop a three-hour pro bono talk for two different Vistage chapters, which consist of local business owners. He is struggling to brainstorm a topic that is general enough to be valuable for a diverse audience but not so technical that it loses their interest.

**Their Commitment for Next week:**

Do a better job on the Vistage presentation ideas.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment to "do a better job" is a vague intention. It lacks a specific, measurable outcome, such as creating an outline, defining topics, or creating a set number of slides.

**Exact Quote:**

"...that's my… accountability that I'll do a better job on these visage ideas, and any help is more than welcome."

**Timestamp:**

(52m 19s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Create a high-level outline with 3 potential topics for the Vistage talk" OR "Send an email to both Vistage chapter leaders asking for their top 3 member pain points."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Bryan Landing those Vistage speaking gigs is a fantastic way to get in front of your ideal audience! That's a huge win.
>
> I noticed your goal to "do a better job" on the ideas wasn't **quantifiable**. I get it—it’s tough to structure a 3-hour talk that’s both engaging and valuable.
>
> Here are a few concrete options to get the ball rolling:
>
> • 📝 Create a high-level outline with 3 potential talk topics.
>
> • 📧 Email the 2 Vistage chapter leaders asking for their members’ top challenges.
>
> • 🧠 Brainstorm 10 specific stories or case studies you could use as examples.

### Joel

**What They Discussed:**

Joel is preparing a proposal for a prospective client, a 9-person custom power cable manufacturer aiming to scale from $10M to $30M. The client is struggling with a cheap ERP system and has no internal tech staff, so he plans to propose a $10k discovery workshop and roadmap. He discussed the importance of setting expectations with the client, especially regarding their aggressive timeline, and shared that he would present the proposal on Friday morning.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

To complete and present the proposal for his new prospect.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This is a specific, binary task (the proposal is either done or not) with a clear deliverable and a time reference ("this week" and presenting on Friday).

**Exact Quote:**

### Matthew Butler

**What They Discussed:**

Matthew shared a busy upcoming schedule, including a conference, onboarding for a university's venture mentoring service, and a follow-up meeting with a promising startup founder. He mentioned his recent switch to using Trello for his workflow to track contacts from conferences. He also shared a creative, non-work-related project to help a friend promote a new book by taking photos of it in unique locations.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Reach out to some people from YouTube.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This goal is a statement of general focus rather than a specific commitment. "Reaching out" is vague, and "some of the people" lacks a specific, measurable number.

**Exact Quote:**

"It's mainly just the conference, reaching out to some of the… People do on YouTube, and um… And that's about it."

**Timestamp:**

(49m 40s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send connection requests to 5 people I met at the conference" OR "Follow up with the startup founder to schedule our meeting for next week."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Matthew It sounds like your networking is really paying off, especially with the promising connection you made via your daughter—that’s awesome!
>
> I noticed you didn’t set a **quantifiable goal** during the call. It's tough to nail one down when you have so many different things happening at once!
>
> To help focus your efforts for next week, here are a few options:
>
> • 📈 Move 10 new contacts into your Trello board.
>
> • 🤝 Schedule the follow-up meeting with the startup founder.
>
> • 🎤 Identify and reach out to 3 people you want to connect with from YouTube.

### Jon Benedict

**What They Discussed:**

Jon is on-site for a new, well-paying interim role in rural New Hampshire and is facing significant challenges. He is struggling with extremely poor internet and cell service at his temporary housing, which complicates his work. His main discussion point was the highly dysfunctional IT team he has inherited, which he described as overstaffed, incompetent, and entangled in personal drama, making it difficult to implement necessary changes.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

**Why This Classification:**

Jon provided a detailed update on his current complex situation and past progress but did not state a new, forward-looking commitment for the upcoming week. His time was focused on explaining the challenges he is facing.

"No specific commitment made"

**Timestamp:**

N/A

### Jeremie Kilgore

**What They Discussed:**

Jeremie shared that he was traveling last week and, while he made some progress, didn't complete everything he wanted to. He is currently struggling with imposter syndrome, which is causing hesitation and self-doubt about his outreach messaging. He wants to push past this to make new connections and talk about what he's doing.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Send out 5 outreach messages this week.

**Classification:**

Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

The commitment includes a specific number ("5 messages") and a clear time reference ("over this next week").

He has also been activating his "golden network," which led to a high-value meeting with the CEO of a healthcare unicorn. While he's getting good traction from LinkedIn posts and having great conversations, he noted that he did not get his two planned case studies completed.

Publish two more LinkedIn posts and send 10 more outreach messages.

### Venkat Vellaichamy

**What They Discussed:**

Venkat is currently in Seattle to meet with friends and activate his local network. His main focus is on the foundational work for his business, including designing his website with Figma and exploring different CRM tools, specifically considering Zoho One. He mentioned he reached out to one lead from a shared channel but is still in a phase of learning and building.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

No specific commitment made

**Classification:**

No Goal

Venkat gave a status update on his current activities (website design, CRM research) but did not state an explicit action item to be completed by the next call.

**Exact Quote:**

"No specific commitment made"

**Timestamp:**

N/A

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Complete the Figma mockup for the website homepage" OR "Make a final decision on a CRM and complete the initial setup."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Venkat Awesome that you’re in Seattle activating your network in person—that’s a fantastic way to build connections. It's also great that you're diving deep into Figma and CRM tools to build a solid foundation.
>

> To help you turn that learning into tangible progress, here are a few options:
> 
> • 🎨 Complete the final Figma mockup for your homepage
> 
> • ✅ Make a final decision on your CRM (e.g., Zoho One)

### Mack Earnhardt | Agile Reasoning

**What They Discussed:**

Mack was very open about feeling "completely stuck" for the past two weeks, stating that he feels like he has gotten almost nothing done. He explained that this is a recurring issue where he loses momentum for a period of time. As a result, his goals are the same as they were two weeks ago, and he is looking for a way to get moving again.

**Their Commitment for Next Week:**

Book time with Marissa for a coaching session.

**Classification:**

Not Quantifiable

**Why This Classification:**

This is a clear action item, but it lacks a specific deadline or time reference (e.g., "by Friday"). It states the intention to act without a time constraint.

**Exact Quote:**

"Well, yeah, that's… that would be a good to-do, is, uh… book timer from Marissa."

**Timestamp:**

(52m 25s)

**How to Make It Quantifiable:**

"Send the scheduling email to Marissa by end-of-day tomorrow" OR "Book the call with Marissa by the end of this week."

**Personalized Accountability Nudge Message:**

> @Mack It takes a lot of self-awareness to recognize when you're stuck and to be open about it—huge props for sharing that with the group. Acknowledging it is the first step to getting moving again.
> 
> 
> I noticed your goal to "book time with Marissa" wasn’t quite **quantifiable**. I know it can be tough to commit to things when you're feeling stuck, so no pressure.
> 
> To add a little structure and help you take that next step, here are a couple of options:
> 
> • 🗓️ Send the email to schedule your call with Marissa by EOD tomorrow
> 
> • 🎯 Identify 1 small, 30-minute task you can complete this week
> 
> Do you want me to hold you accountable to one of these for next week’s check-in? It could be a great way to break the inertia.
